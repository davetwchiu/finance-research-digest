  "macro": "Global macro is in a late-cycle disinflation tug-of-war, not a clean risk-on trend. US 10Y is 4.03% (-0.67% 1w), with equities diverging (S&P 500 +0.02% 1w, Nasdaq +0.36% 1w). VIX at 21.01 (+1.99% 1w) says volatility is contained but not complacent. Oil at 66.29 (+5.41% 1w) and DXY 97.72 (+0.87% 1w) keep the inflation/financial-conditions channel alive.",
  "policy": "Policy path remains a three-body problem: Fed reaction function (growth vs inflation), US fiscal/defense outlays, and export-control enforcement for AI/advanced compute. Base case is slower easing and data-dependent communication; upside inflation surprises delay cuts and pressure duration-sensitive growth. Any tightening in chip/export rules would hit semiconductor supply chains first, then AI capex expectations.",
  "delta": "Versus the prior run, leadership is narrower: mega-cap quality is more resilient while high-beta defense/space/AI-adjacent small caps are showing wider intraday dispersion. That raises execution risk and favors staged entries over single-shot positioning.",
