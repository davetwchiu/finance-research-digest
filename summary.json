  "macro": "Macro regime remains two-way rather than a one-direction melt-up. US 10Y is 4.03 (-0.67% 1w), S&P 500 +0.02% 1w, Nasdaq +0.36% 1w, VIX at 21.01 (+1.99% 1w). WTI 66.27 (+5.37% 1w) and DXY 97.70 (+0.84% 1w) keep financial conditions from easing too quickly.",
  "policy": "Policy is still dominated by the Fed inflation-vs-growth balancing act, US fiscal/defense spending persistence, and semiconductor export-control implementation risk. Portfolio implication: keep a core in cash-flow durable leaders, and treat high-beta tactical entries as confirmation-dependent trades rather than valuation-only buys.",
  "delta": "Versus the prior run, dispersion is widening again: mega-cap AI beneficiaries are more resilient while smaller defense/space names trade with larger intraday swings. That usually argues for staggered entries, pre-defined invalidations, and faster de-risking on failed breakouts.",
