  "macro": "Rates are still restrictive but no longer in panic repricing mode: US 10Y is around 4.0229997634887695 (1w -0.81%). Equities show constructive but selective risk appetite (S&P 500 1w +0.01%, Nasdaq 1w +0.32%). WTI near 66.18000030517578 keeps inflation upside risk alive but not dominant.",
  "policy": "Policy path remains headline-sensitive: Fed communication is data-dependent, while US export-control and defense-procurement headlines remain key swing factors for semis and aerospace/defense names.",
  "delta": "Compared with yesterday, positioning still favors quality AI platforms, but tactical risk is higher in small/mid-cap defense-space names where liquidity gaps can widen quickly.",
