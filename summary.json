  "macro": "Global macro is still a selective risk-on regime, not a broad melt-up: yields are off highs but not loose enough to underwrite indiscriminate multiple expansion. Dollar firmness and oil volatility keep inflation-risk tails alive, so cross-asset conditions remain fragile.",
  "policy": "Key policy vectors are Fed timing uncertainty, US defense/fiscal persistence, and semiconductor export-control implementation risk. Portfolio implication: keep core exposure in high-cash-flow leaders, and only add high-beta names on confirmed structure + volume.",
  "delta": "Compared with the prior run, the tape still shows widening dispersion: mega-cap quality absorbs shocks better while smaller thematic names whipsaw around catalysts. Execution focus stays on staged entries, hard invalidations, and faster de-risking on failed breakouts.",
