  "market": "Global defence demand remains in a multi-year rebuild phase driven by inventory replenishment, deterrence re-posturing, and interoperability spending; the durable theme is real, but timing remains staircase-like through procurement gates.",
  "tech": "Budget is rotating toward operationally proven autonomy, EW, ISR fusion, and secure communications, with winners defined by integration and field reliability rather than headline AI narratives.",
  "risk": "Top risks are production ramp failure, fixed-price margin stress, and policy/appropriation timing shocks; valuation risk is highest where narrative momentum outpaces funded backlog conversion and free-cash-flow delivery.",
