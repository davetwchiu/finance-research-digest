      <h2>How to read this notebook</h2>
      <p>This is intentionally long-form. It is written as a decision notebook, not a news summary. The goal is to separate what is monetizing now from what is still narrative, and to map where value capture is likely to concentrate over the next 3/6/12 months.</p>
      <div class="kpi">
        <div><span class="pill bull">Core call</span><br/>AI remains a real platform shift, but returns are getting more selective and increasingly tied to distribution + workflow ownership rather than raw model scores.</div>
        <div><span class="pill warn">Base case</span><br/>2026 is the year of conversion pressure: markets will demand proof that pilot spend becomes recurring production revenue.</div>
        <div><span class="pill bear">Main risk</span><br/>If demand growth slows before supply constraints clear, we can get simultaneous margin compression in infra and de-rating in application multiples.</div>

      <h2>(1) Executive thesis and key calls</h2>
      <h3>Executive thesis</h3>
      <p>The AI stack is moving from <strong>capacity race</strong> to <strong>economic race</strong>. In 2023–2025, the market rewarded who could secure GPUs, launch frontier models, and announce AI roadmaps. In 2026, the bar rises: who can deliver durable margins after accounting for inference cost, sales friction, governance overhead, and customer churn?</p>
      <p>My central view: <strong>the biggest winners over the next 12 months are not necessarily the companies with the best models; they are the ones with the best distribution, integration depth, and cost discipline</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Key calls (strong views)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Call #1 — Value capture shifts up-stack:</strong> Compute suppliers still print strong revenue, but incremental alpha rotates toward software firms that own user workflows (Microsoft 365/Copilot stack, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Adobe, Atlassian, enterprise vertical AI specialists).</li>
        <li><strong>Call #2 — Frontier model quality is converging faster than pricing:</strong> A few labs remain ahead (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind), but many workloads are now “good enough,” weakening premium pricing unless tied to proprietary data, trust, or distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Call #3 — Inference economics becomes the critical battleground:</strong> The era of “train once, monetize forever” is over-simplified. Real profitability depends on routing, caching, quantization, model mix, and product design that limits wasteful token usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Call #4 — Enterprise conversion is improving but uneven:</strong> Best-in-class conversion from pilot to production is happening in customer support, software engineering copilots, search/knowledge work, and document automation. Lagging categories: broad “AI assistants” without workflow embedding.</li>
        <li><strong>Call #5 — Geopolitics is now a first-order valuation variable:</strong> Export controls, cloud sovereignty, and energy-security constraints can change supply assumptions and revenue addressability quickly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Implication by ecosystem names</h3>
      <p><strong>NVIDIA/TSMC/ASML/AMD/Broadcom:</strong> still central to the picks-and-shovels layer, but expectations are high; execution misses can re-rate quickly.</p>
      <p><strong>Microsoft/Amazon/Google:</strong> best positioned to monetize AI through bundled distribution and enterprise channels, but must prove AI margins are additive, not cannibalistic.</p>
      <p><strong>OpenAI/Anthropic/xAI/Mistral/Cohere:</strong> productization and distribution partnerships matter more than benchmark headlines.</p>
      <p><strong>ServiceNow/Salesforce/Adobe/Intuit/Palantir/SAP/Oracle:</strong> strong chance to compound if AI is embedded into existing mission-critical workflows with measurable ROI.</p>
    </div>

        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>Bottom line: the stack is no longer linear. Winners increasingly coordinate across layers (e.g., cloud + model + app + services). The strongest moat is often <strong>cross-layer control</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(3) Demand analysis</h2>
      <h3>Enterprise adoption: from experimentation to procurement discipline</h3>
      <p>Most large enterprises are now in their second wave of AI programs. Wave 1 (2023–2024) was discovery and pilots. Wave 2 (2025–2026) is selective rollout with procurement controls and ROI requirements. CIOs are asking more direct questions: “What workflow gets faster? How many FTE-equivalents? What error rates? What compliance burden?”</p>

      <h3>Where adoption is genuinely working</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Customer support:</strong> AI triage + draft response + call summarization is producing measurable handle-time reduction.</li>
        <li><strong>Software engineering copilots:</strong> strongest where codebase quality and internal standards are high.</li>
        <li><strong>Document-heavy operations:</strong> legal review, claims processing, contract extraction, KYC onboarding.</li>
        <li><strong>Internal knowledge search:</strong> enterprise RAG stacks with permissions-aware retrieval show practical productivity gains.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Where demand still looks soft / fragile</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Generic chatbots not embedded into daily workflow systems.</li>
        <li>Consumer AI subscriptions with weak retention beyond early adopters.</li>
        <li>Agentic automation claims with limited production reliability and high exception-handling cost.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Pricing power</h3>
      <p>Pricing power is splitting:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strong:</strong> products tied to mission-critical workflows and compliance-heavy contexts (higher switching cost).</li>
        <li><strong>Weakening:</strong> standalone assistant SKUs where alternatives are close enough and switching is easy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Pilot-to-production conversion: key reality check</h3>
      <p>The crucial KPI for 2026 is conversion quality, not pilot count. Healthy conversion profile:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pilot in < 90 days</li>
        <li>Clear KPI baseline before deployment</li>
        <li>Cross-functional owner (IT + business unit + risk/compliance)</li>
        <li>Budget line moved from innovation fund to operating budget</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Weak profile: indefinite sandbox usage, no owner, no budget transfer, no integration roadmap.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(4) Supply analysis</h2>
      <h3>Chips and packaging</h3>
      <p>Supply constraints are easing at the margin but remain binding at the high end. Advanced packaging (CoWoS-like capacity), HBM memory, and high-performance networking continue to constrain full-system availability. The bottleneck has moved from “can I buy a GPU?” to “can I deploy complete AI clusters at target utilization?”</p>

      <h3>Cloud capacity</h3>
      <p>Hyperscalers expanded aggressively, but capacity utilization quality now matters more than headline capacity growth. If utilization falls due to overbuild or weaker enterprise demand conversion, cloud AI margins can compress quickly.</p>

      <h3>Power and energy</h3>
      <p>Power is becoming a strategic asset. Data center site selection is now deeply tied to grid reliability, permitting speed, cooling design, and long-term power purchase agreements. AI capex cannot scale infinitely without transmission upgrades and local permitting alignment.</p>

      <h3>Talent bottlenecks</h3>
      <p>The bottleneck is no longer only model researchers. Scarcity is now acute in <strong>AI product engineers</strong>, <strong>inference optimization specialists</strong>, <strong>security/compliance practitioners</strong>, and <strong>domain experts who can redesign workflows</strong>. This favors companies with deep internal platforms and strong developer ecosystems.</p>

      <h3>Analyst view</h3>
      <p>Supply-side easing alone will not destroy pricing. It will redistribute economics from scarce hardware toward software and services that can convert cheaper inference into customer value. Lower compute cost is bullish for usage growth, but bearish for undifferentiated model pricing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(5) Technology frontier and practical breakthroughs</h2>
      <h3>What is hype</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Benchmark theater:</strong> small benchmark gains marketed as broad commercial breakthroughs.</li>
        <li><strong>“Fully autonomous agents” claims:</strong> still brittle for complex workflows requiring deterministic control and auditability.</li>
        <li><strong>One-model-does-everything narratives:</strong> enterprise stacks increasingly use model routing, not single-model dependence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What is monetizing now</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inference optimization:</strong> quantization, speculative decoding, caching, distillation, and workload-specific serving stacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Data layer improvements:</strong> better retrieval quality, permissions-aware indexing, and observability around hallucination/error modes.</li>
        <li><strong>Workflow-native AI UX:</strong> embedding AI into existing software surfaces rather than asking users to switch contexts.</li>
        <li><strong>Multimodal enterprise use cases:</strong> document, voice, image workflows with strict governance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technology frontier over next 12 months</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Frontier theme</th><th>Commercial relevance (12m)</th><th>Who benefits</th><th>Risk</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Agent orchestration + tool reliability</td><td>Medium-High</td><td>Platform vendors + vertical SaaS</td><td>Failure handling and audit complexity</td></tr>
        <tr><td>On-device / edge AI acceleration</td><td>Medium</td><td>Apple, Qualcomm, handset/PC OEMs, app ecosystems</td><td>Fragmentation and limited model sizes</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Reasoning improvements with cost controls</td><td>High</td><td>Top labs + cloud providers</td><td>Inference cost creep if not optimized</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Video generation at scale</td><td>Medium</td><td>Media/marketing tools</td><td>Copyright/legal monetization friction</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(6) Competitive dynamics and moats by segment</h2>
      <h3>Compute layer</h3>
      <p><strong>Moat:</strong> ecosystem lock-in (CUDA/toolchains), manufacturing partnerships, software stack maturity, and systems integration capability.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> customer concentration and custom silicon by hyperscalers may cap long-run pricing power.</p>

      <h3>Model layer</h3>
      <p><strong>Moat:</strong> safety/reliability track record, enterprise trust, proprietary data partnerships, and distribution channels.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> rapid capability diffusion and open-weight alternatives reduce defensibility of “model quality alone.”</p>

      <h3>Application layer</h3>
      <p><strong>Moat:</strong> owning workflow, identity/access integration, and deep domain data.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> fast feature parity; many app vendors risk becoming thin wrappers unless they control process and data gravity.</p>

      <h3>Services layer</h3>
      <p><strong>Moat:</strong> client relationships, industry specialization, and delivery capability across legacy systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> labor-intensive economics and potential margin dilution as clients demand outcome-based pricing.</p>

      <h3>Hard view</h3>
      <p>Durable moat in AI is increasingly a <strong>system moat</strong>, not a single-asset moat. The company that controls distribution + data + workflow + compliance gets paid repeatedly; others fight for episodic revenue.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(7) Financial architecture</h2>
      <h3>Capex intensity</h3>
      <p>AI infrastructure remains capex-heavy. The key question is no longer whether capex is large; it is whether revenue quality and gross margin trajectory can justify that capex over a multi-year cycle. Investors should track <strong>capex-to-incremental-gross-profit</strong>, not just capex growth rates.</p>

      <h3>Unit economics framework (practical)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Revenue side:</strong> ARPU uplift from AI features, seat expansion, usage-based monetization, churn reduction.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost side:</strong> inference cost per task, support overhead, compliance/monitoring cost, cloud pass-through exposure.</li>
        <li><strong>Margin durability:</strong> can vendor lower cost per output faster than price declines?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Cash-flow quality</h3>
      <p>High-quality AI cash flow has three signatures:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Recurring production usage (not one-off pilots)</li>
        <li>Visible renewals with expanding scope</li>
        <li>Improving gross margin despite scaling usage</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Where financial risk hides</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Capitalized AI development masking true run-rate costs</li>
        <li>Bundled pricing that delays clear monetization signals</li>
        <li>Deferred revenue growth from discounts that may not renew at list price</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Strong analyst stance</h3>
      <p>In 2026, “AI story with weak free-cash-flow conversion” should be discounted more aggressively than in prior years. Liquidity can no longer carry every narrative. Evidence beats storytelling.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(8) Geopolitics and export-control scenario analysis</h2>
      <h3>Core geopolitical vectors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>US export-control tightening on advanced chips and manufacturing tools</li>
        <li>China domestic substitution push in semis and AI stacks</li>
        <li>Regional cloud sovereignty mandates (EU, Middle East, parts of APAC)</li>
        <li>Potential retaliation channels (critical minerals, market access, procurement bans)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Scenario analysis</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Probability (12m)</th><th>Impact</th><th>Likely market reaction</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Incremental tightening (base case)</td><td>High</td><td>Manageable but persistent frictions</td><td>Rotation within winners; valuation dispersion widens</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Sharp escalation with broader restrictions</td><td>Medium</td><td>Supply chain shock, delayed deployments</td><td>Infra volatility spikes; sovereign cloud themes outperform</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Stabilization / détente</td><td>Low-Medium</td><td>Improved planning visibility</td><td>Risk-on across semis and growth software</td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>Practical implication: maintain a “geopolitical haircut” in valuation models, especially for firms with concentrated manufacturing or region-sensitive revenue exposure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(9) Policy/regulatory landscape and likely pathways</h2>
      <h3>Regulatory direction of travel</h3>
      <p>Regulation is moving from principle to implementation. Expect increased requirements around data provenance, model risk management, auditability, sector-specific compliance, and consumer protection disclosures.</p>

      <h3>Likely pathway (next 12 months)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>More sector-specific guidance (finance, healthcare, public sector)</li>
        <li>Procurement standards that require demonstrable governance controls</li>
        <li>Greater legal clarity on synthetic media labeling and IP liability boundaries</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Commercial implication</h3>
      <p>Compliance is shifting from “cost center” to “sales enabler.” Vendors with strong governance tooling can close enterprise deals faster and at better economics.</p>
