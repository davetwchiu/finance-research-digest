    <h1>AI Industry Research Notebook (in-depth, plain-language)</h1>
    <p class="muted">Prepared for David • Wednesday, 25 Feb 2026 (09:30 HKT run) • Objective: deep strategic map of where AI value is real, where it is fragile, and what to monitor to avoid narrative traps.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>How to use this notebook</h2>
      <p>This is written as a working investment memo, not a hype digest. The core question: <strong>which parts of AI can convert technical progress into repeatable free cash flow, and which parts are likely to become commoditized utilities?</strong></p>
      <p>Public data availability is uneven in early 2026. Where exact numbers are still noisy, this notebook emphasizes <strong>decision quality</strong>: unit economics, bottleneck mapping, policy paths, and falsifiable signposts.</p>
      <div class="kpi">
        <div><span class="pill bull">Primary call</span><br/>AI remains a multi-year platform shift, but market leadership is rotating from raw model spectacle to workflow control + cost discipline.</div>
        <div><span class="pill warn">Base case</span><br/>2026 is a “proof-of-economics” year: strong capex continues, but valuation spreads widen sharply based on monetization quality.</div>
        <div><span class="pill bear">Main risk</span><br/>If capex growth remains extreme while conversion-to-production lags, de-rating can hit both infrastructure and software simultaneously.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(1) Executive thesis and key calls</h2>
      <h3>Thesis in one sentence</h3>
      <p>The AI cycle is moving from <strong>scarcity economics</strong> (who can get chips) to <strong>operating economics</strong> (who can deliver reliable outcomes at acceptable cost under governance constraints).</p>

      <h3>Five key calls (high conviction)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>The next durable profit pool is enterprise workflow ownership, not standalone chatbot subscriptions.</strong> Benchmarks still matter, but buyers are paying for measurable task completion, integration depth, and legal/compliance confidence.</li>
        <li><strong>Compute remains structurally attractive, but no longer “automatic multiple expansion.”</strong> NVDA/TSM/AVGO chains can keep compounding fundamentals, but valuation now depends on utilization durability, customer concentration, and substitution pace (custom silicon, architecture shifts).</li>
        <li><strong>Inference efficiency is now a first-order strategic moat.</strong> Distillation, routing, quantization, caching, and hardware-software co-design are direct gross-margin levers; companies ignoring this will report AI growth with weak incremental profitability.</li>
        <li><strong>Pilot-to-production conversion is the KPI that matters in 2026.</strong> “We signed X pilots” is low-signal. High-signal is conversion within two quarters, active usage depth, and expansion into core operating budgets.</li>
        <li><strong>Geopolitics + power are regime variables, not side risks.</strong> Export controls, packaging choke points, and grid interconnection constraints can move earnings trajectories more than product launches.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Practical implications for listed ecosystem names</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure complex (NVDA, AVGO, TSM, memory, optics, cooling, power infra):</strong> still core structural winners, but dispersion widens as supply catches up and procurement becomes more selective.</li>
        <li><strong>Hyperscalers/platforms (MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, META, ORCL):</strong> capex intensity has reset higher; investors will demand cleaner linkage between AI demand, utilization, and margin durability.</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise software/workflow control (MSFT suite stack, CRM/ERP ecosystems, service management, cyber/identity):</strong> likely best 12–24 month risk-adjusted monetization path if AI attaches to existing distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Services/integration layer (IBM, Accenture peers, domain-focused implementers, PLTR-style deployment platforms):</strong> strong demand where governance + change management are hard, but labor intensity caps margin unless automation improves delivery model.</li>
        <li><strong>Device-edge ecosystem (AAPL, AI PCs/phones, secure edge):</strong> underappreciated if on-device + private-cloud architecture improves privacy, latency, and retention economics.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(2) Industry map by value chain (compute → models → software/apps → enterprise services)</h2>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Layer</th><th>Economic role</th><th>Representative exposures</th><th>Current profit quality</th><th>Structural fragility</th></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Compute</strong></td><td>Accelerators, foundry, CoWoS/advanced packaging, HBM, networking, optical interconnect, cooling/power</td><td>NVDA, TSM, AVGO, memory + optical chains, infra REIT/power-linked beneficiaries</td><td>Highest near-term dollar capture</td><td>Concentration risk, policy restrictions, eventual utilization normalization</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Model layer</strong></td><td>Foundation models, alignment/safety, eval stacks, fine-tuning infra</td><td>Frontier labs + hyperscaler internal models + open-model ecosystems</td><td>Strategic, but standalone monetization uneven</td><td>Capability diffusion + API price compression</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Software/apps</strong></td><td>Copilots, domain agents, workflow automation, data/analytics assistants</td><td>MSFT/GOOG productivity, CRM/ERP suites, vertical AI vendors</td><td>Most attractive medium-term if deeply embedded</td><td>Fast feature cloning for shallow wrappers</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Enterprise services</strong></td><td>Implementation, governance, model risk controls, process redesign</td><td>Consulting/SI + specialized deployment platforms</td><td>Demand resilient in regulated sectors</td><td>Labor-heavy model + pricing pressure toward outcomes</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Where value migration is happening now</h3>
      <p><strong>2023–2025:</strong> value concentrated in scarce compute and frontier-model novelty.<br/>
      <strong>2026 onward:</strong> value broadens toward <em>cross-layer control systems</em>—cloud + model + data rights + identity + workflow + audit trail.</p>

      <h3>What this means for portfolio construction</h3>
      <p>Treat “AI” as a portfolio of linked but different businesses. The cycle is no longer one beta trade. You need separate books for: (1) supply scarcity beneficiaries, (2) monetization converters, (3) regulatory/sovereignty-adapted operators.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(3) Demand analysis: enterprise adoption, consumer uptake, pricing power, pilot → production</h2>
      <h3>Enterprise adoption is broad; production maturity is uneven</h3>
      <p>Survey evidence and field commentary indicate high experimentation and rising regular use, but uneven conversion to large-scale production with robust controls. McKinsey’s 2025 work highlights that many firms are “rewiring” operating models, yet only a subset report clear EBIT impact pathways.</p>

      <h3>Where conversion is strongest today</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Customer operations:</strong> AI-assisted resolution, triage, knowledge retrieval, QA, and post-call workflow automation.</li>
        <li><strong>Software engineering:</strong> coding copilots tied to test coverage, bug reduction, and deployment-cycle acceleration.</li>
        <li><strong>Document-heavy regulated workflows:</strong> claims, underwriting support, KYC/onboarding, legal drafting, compliance review.</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise search + retrieval:</strong> permissioned, policy-aware access to internal knowledge with auditable logs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Where demand still looks fragile</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Generic chat overlays without workflow integration.</li>
        <li>“Fully autonomous” multi-step agents with weak exception handling.</li>
        <li>Consumer paid tiers where novelty usage is high but habit depth is shallow.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Pricing power: where it exists and where it fades</h3>
      <p>Pricing power is strongest when AI can be attached to hard KPIs (cost-per-case down, cycle-time down, conversion up, error rates down, audit pass rates up). It fades rapidly when value proposition is generic text/image generation with low switching friction.</p>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Demand segment</th><th>Likely pricing power</th><th>Reason</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Regulated workflow automation</td><td>High</td><td>Outcome-linked ROI + compliance burden + integration depth</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Embedded productivity AI in incumbent suites</td><td>Medium-High</td><td>Distribution leverage + contract bundling</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Developer tools with measurable velocity gains</td><td>Medium</td><td>Strong value but competitive crowding risk</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Standalone generic assistant apps</td><td>Low</td><td>High substitutability + price anchoring by low-cost alternatives</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Core KPI framework for 2026 demand quality</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Pilot conversion rate within 6 months</li>
        <li>Share of deployments in operating budgets (vs innovation budget)</li>
        <li>90-day active usage depth by role</li>
        <li>Renewal + expansion net of serving costs</li>
        <li>Measured human rework rate after AI outputs</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Analyst view:</strong> companies that disclose these metrics deserve premium multiples over peers reporting only AI seat counts or “engagement anecdotes.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(4) Supply analysis: chips, packaging, cloud capacity, power/energy, talent bottlenecks</h2>
      <h3>Chips and advanced packaging</h3>
      <p>Frontier accelerator demand remains robust, but bottlenecks are increasingly system-level: advanced packaging throughput, HBM availability, server integration speed, and rack-level power/cooling architecture. This favors scale buyers with priority allocation and integrated deployment muscle.</p>

      <h3>Cloud capacity buildout: from scarcity to utilization debate</h3>
      <p>Hyperscaler capex has structurally stepped up. The critical debate is no longer “will they spend?” but “can they keep utilization high while preserving margins?”
      Reported commentary from hyperscalers has increasingly centered on tokens-per-watt economics and throughput efficiency, signaling a shift from pure expansion to productivity of compute fleets.</p>

      <h3>Power and energy are now hard constraints</h3>
      <p>IEA’s 2025 energy-AI analysis estimates data center electricity consumption at ~415 TWh in 2024 and projects ~945 TWh by 2030 in the base case, with AI-accelerated workloads as a key driver. That means infrastructure bottlenecks are no longer only semiconductor bottlenecks; they are <strong>grid, permitting, cooling, and interconnection</strong> bottlenecks too.</p>

      <h3>Talent bottleneck has shifted</h3>
      <p>The limiting human resource in 2026 is less “elite model scientist” and more “enterprise deployment operator”: platform engineers, AI governance leads, security architects, and domain process owners who can run reliable production systems.</p>

      <h3>Supply-side conclusion</h3>
      <p>Supply stress is improving vs peak panic, but remains constrained in quieter ways. The next bottleneck cycle is subtler and operational—not just chip headline scarcity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(5) Technology frontier and practical breakthroughs (what is hype vs monetizing)</h2>
      <h3>What is monetizing now</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI copilots tied to workflow systems of record</strong> (developer, support, productivity, operations).</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise retrieval + policy-aware orchestration</strong> (access control + auditability + low hallucination tolerance).</li>
        <li><strong>Inference cost engineering stack</strong> (quantization, caching, routing, speculative decoding, distillation).</li>
        <li><strong>Practical multimodal</strong> in document, voice, and visual enterprise pipelines.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What remains mostly hype (for now)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Claims of broad unattended autonomous execution across messy enterprise processes.</li>
        <li>Benchmark-first narratives with weak production reliability metrics.</li>
        <li>Consumer AI features that demo well but do not establish durable usage loops.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Important frontier truth: capability is compounding, but unit value per capability point is falling</h3>
      <p>Stanford HAI’s 2025 AI Index highlights steep inference-cost decline for GPT-3.5-equivalent quality over 2022–2024. This is bullish for adoption, but it also means raw model capability can commoditize faster unless paired with distribution, data rights, or workflow lock-in.</p>

      <h3>Breakthroughs to monitor over next 12 months</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Reliable reasoning + tool-use under enterprise constraints</strong> (determinism, policy boundaries, post-hoc traceability).</li>
        <li><strong>Edge/private deployment maturity</strong> for low-latency and data sovereignty use cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Governance automation tooling</strong> (continuous eval, policy simulation, incident response orchestration).</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Analyst view:</strong> the market still overpays for “model theater” and underpays for “boring AI plumbing” that actually protects margins and retention.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(6) Competitive dynamics and moats by segment</h2>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Segment</th><th>Moat sources that matter</th><th>How moats decay</th><th>Current assessment</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Compute ecosystems</td><td>Software stack lock-in, developer tooling, full-system optimization, roadmap visibility</td><td>Custom silicon adoption, open alternatives, buyer concentration pressure</td><td><strong>Strong</strong>, but increasingly scrutinized</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Foundation model providers</td><td>Reliability, safety stack, enterprise trust, ecosystem integrations</td><td>Quality convergence, lower-cost substitutes, rapid open-model progress</td><td><strong>Mixed</strong> unless paired with distribution</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Enterprise application vendors</td><td>Workflow embedding, data gravity, procurement trust, change-management footprint</td><td>Feature cloning by platforms, weak activation, low switching cost if shallow embed</td><td><strong>Best medium-term moat potential</strong></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Enterprise services/SI</td><td>Domain-specific transformation capability, governance execution at scale</td><td>Labor compression from AI tools, client insourcing</td><td><strong>Durable demand</strong>, margin selective</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Moat hierarchy for 2026</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Distribution + workflow control</li>
        <li>Serving-cost efficiency + reliability</li>
        <li>Governance/compliance credibility</li>
        <li>Model benchmark leadership (still important, but less monetizable by itself)</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Name-level strategic notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MSFT:</strong> strongest if it keeps proving cross-layer capture (infrastructure, productivity, enterprise contracts) and protects margin via inference efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>AMZN:</strong> upside tied to AWS monetization depth + custom silicon economics (Trainium/Inferentia-like strategy) + capacity utilization.</li>
        <li><strong>GOOG:</strong> unique advantage in model research + distribution surfaces; key question is revenue mix quality versus compute spend.</li>
        <li><strong>META:</strong> powerful ad-distribution flywheel and open-model influence; key monitor is ROI transparency of very large capex plans.</li>
        <li><strong>NVDA/TSM/AVGO complex:</strong> moat remains real but increasingly judged on demand breadth and sustainability, not just headline shortage.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(7) Financial architecture: capex intensity, unit economics, margin durability, cash-flow quality</h2>
      <h3>The capex regime has permanently shifted up</h3>
      <p>The market has accepted higher capex for strategic AI positioning. What it has not accepted—and will punish—is capex with weak downstream monetization evidence. In other words: capex is fine, capex without quality conversion is not.</p>

      <h3>Unit economics scorecard (practical analyst template)</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Question</th><th>Why it matters</th><th>Green signal</th><th>Red signal</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Revenue per active AI workflow</td><td>Measures monetization density</td><td>Rising with usage depth</td><td>Flat despite user growth</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Variable serving cost per workflow</td><td>Direct gross-margin determinant</td><td>Declining via routing/optimization</td><td>Cost rises faster than usage value</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Implementation payback period</td><td>Enterprise scaling viability</td><td>&lt; 12–18 months in key workflows</td><td>Open-ended payback assumptions</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Renewal + expansion net of cost-to-serve</td><td>True quality of ARR-like claims</td><td>Healthy expansion after cost normalization</td><td>Expansion dependent on subsidy pricing</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Cash conversion quality</td><td>Separates accounting growth vs real economics</td><td>OCF and FCF keep pace with AI revenue claims</td><td>Narrative growth + deteriorating cash quality</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Margin durability in AI software</h3>
      <p>Margin durability is less about list price and more about operating system design: model routing, cache-hit rates, retrieval quality, and escalation logic to humans. Teams can keep ASP stable and still lose margin if workload mix shifts to expensive inference without tight controls.</p>

      <h3>Capex interpretation framework for hyperscalers</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Productive capex:</strong> linked to visible demand, signed backlog, and utilization pathways.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic option capex:</strong> rational but uncertain near-term returns.</li>
        <li><strong>Defensive capex:</strong> spend driven by fear of missing out rather than unit economics.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Analyst bias:</strong> reward names that explicitly separate these categories in reporting language and guidance discipline.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(8) Geopolitics and export-control scenario analysis</h2>
      <h3>Why geopolitics belongs inside valuation, not in footnotes</h3>
      <p>Export controls now affect chips, toolchains, cloud-access pathways, and increasingly compliance burden. This directly changes TAM, pricing, and supply-chain geometry.</p>

      <table>
        <tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Description</th><th>Winners</th><th>Pressure points</th></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Managed tension (base)</strong></td><td>Rules tighten incrementally; licensing remains selective; adaptation possible with compliance investment</td><td>Diversified global operators with legal/compliance scale</td><td>Mid-tier vendors with limited compliance infrastructure</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Hard fragmentation</strong></td><td>Broader restrictions and reciprocal controls; duplicated stacks by geopolitical bloc</td><td>Domestic champions and sovereign-cloud providers</td><td>Global efficiency, cross-border model deployment, multinational supply chains</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Partial thaw</strong></td><td>Targeted easing in specific categories with strict guardrails</td><td>Large players able to execute complex licensing and monitoring</td><td>Narratives based on permanent scarcity premiums</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Current signal set</h3>
      <p>BIS activity remains elevated, including periodic rule revisions and enforcement actions; directionally this indicates continuing export-control salience rather than policy normalization.</p>

      <h3>Portfolio implication</h3>
      <p>Treat concentration in single chokepoints (specific foundry lane, packaging dependency, jurisdiction-specific licensing) as an explicit risk-budget item, not a macro afterthought.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(9) Policy/regulatory landscape and likely pathways</h2>
      <h3>Regulation is converging on accountability of deployment</h3>
      <p>Across US/EU/Asia, direction of travel is practical accountability: risk classification, documentation, traceability, incident handling, and rights protections. The EU AI Act timeline and prohibited-practice guidance make this concrete for high-risk deployments and GPAI-adjacent obligations.</p>

      <h3>Economic consequences</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Compliance cost is becoming a moat.</strong> Large incumbents can absorb it; undercapitalized fast-followers may struggle.</li>
        <li><strong>Procurement standards are tightening.</strong> Buyers increasingly require indemnification, audit trails, and governance controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Localization burden rises.</strong> Regulatory divergence forces product, legal, and data-architecture variation by jurisdiction.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Likely pathway (next 12 months)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>More explicit implementation guidance and enforcement examples</li>
        <li>Higher legal scrutiny on high-impact enterprise and public-sector use cases</li>
        <li>Stronger role for third-party assurance and AI risk tooling</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Analyst view:</strong> regulation is not purely a tax on growth. It can improve industry structure by filtering low-quality supply and rewarding operators with serious controls.</p>

      <h2>(11) Scenario tree (3 / 6 / 12 months) with signposts</h2>
      <h3>3 months (tactical tape)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Base (55%)</strong>: AI demand remains solid; markets reward names with monetization clarity and punish vague capex narratives.</li>
        <li><strong>Bull (25%)</strong>: Several hyperscalers show accelerating AI revenue attribution and stable margins; enterprise conversion commentary strengthens.</li>
        <li><strong>Bear (20%)</strong>: Demand quality commentary weakens while spend remains high; valuation compresses broadly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6 months (structure test)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Base (50%)</strong>: Two-speed market forms—high-quality monetizers outperform, narrative-heavy names lag.</li>
        <li><strong>Bull (30%)</strong>: Inference efficiency + workflow embedding drive visible margin resilience across software and cloud.</li>

        <li><strong>Bull (35%)</strong>: Broad earnings upgrades as AI moves into operating budgets with improving unit economics.</li>
        <li><strong>Bear (20%)</strong>: prolonged de-rating if economics fail to match infrastructure scale and policy friction rises.</li>

      <h3>Signposts that matter most</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Explicit AI revenue attribution in hyperscaler disclosures</li>
        <li>Incremental gross margin trend net of AI serving costs</li>
        <li>Pilot-to-production conversion metrics from enterprise vendors</li>
        <li>HBM + advanced packaging lead-time trends</li>
        <li>Grid-connection and data-center commissioning progress by region</li>
        <li>New BIS/EU implementation actions affecting deployment economics</li>

      <h3>What would make me more bullish</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear migration of AI spend from pilot budgets into recurring operating budgets across multiple sectors.</li>
        <li>Evidence that inference-cost declines are being retained as margin, not entirely competed away.</li>
        <li>Demand broadening beyond top concentration points in the compute supply chain.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What would force a bearish reset</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2–3 consecutive reporting cycles where capex growth materially outpaces monetization quality.</li>
        <li>Policy fragmentation that significantly reduces cross-border deployment economics.</li>
        <li>Rapid commoditization of model layer without offsetting moat from distribution/workflow/data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bottom line</h3>
      <p>Stay structurally constructive on AI, but avoid treating the ecosystem as one trade. Overweight names where AI economics are becoming <strong>visible, repeatable, and cash-generative</strong>. Underweight stories that require perfect policy, perfect utilization, and permanent pricing power to work.</p>
