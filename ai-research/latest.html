    <h1>AI Industry Research Notebook (30–45 min read)</h1>
    <p class="muted">Prepared for David • Wednesday, 25 Feb 2026 (09:30 HKT run) • Plain-language, high-conviction analyst notebook focused on value capture, durability, and signposts that can falsify the thesis.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>How to read this notebook</h2>
      <p>This is not a hype digest. It is a decision tool. The core question is: <strong>who captures durable economics in AI after the first infrastructure rush?</strong> The framework prioritizes conversion to production, unit economics, margin quality, and geopolitical sensitivity.</p>
      <div class="kpi">
        <div><span class="pill bull">Top call</span><br/>AI remains a real multi-year platform shift, but market leadership is rotating from raw model novelty to companies that control customer workflow, distribution, and cost-to-serve.</div>
        <div><span class="pill warn">Base case</span><br/>2026 is a “proof-of-economics” year: winners show pilot-to-production conversion, inference efficiency, and governance-ready deployment at scale.</div>
        <div><span class="pill bear">Main risk</span><br/>If capex growth stays extreme while monetization quality lags, multiple compression can hit infrastructure and software simultaneously.</div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(1) Executive thesis and key calls</h2>
      <h3>Executive thesis</h3>
      <p>The industry is transitioning from <strong>scarcity economics</strong> (who can secure GPUs and launch bigger models) to <strong>operating economics</strong> (who can deliver reliable output at acceptable cost with measurable customer ROI). That transition has two big consequences:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Benchmark leadership is still useful, but no longer sufficient.</strong> Buyers increasingly pay for task reliability, compliance fit, integration depth, and workflow ownership.</li>
        <li><strong>The center of gravity is shifting from “model as product” to “model inside product.”</strong> Distribution and data gravity are becoming stronger moats than model branding alone.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Key calls (high conviction)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Call A — Enterprise software incumbents are still underappreciated in AI value capture.</strong> The biggest monetization pool in 12–24 months is likely inside installed enterprise surfaces (productivity suites, CRM/ERP workflows, cloud security/identity layers), not standalone chatbot subscriptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Call B — Compute remains structurally attractive, but no longer “easy mode.”</strong> NVDA/TSM/AVGO ecosystem can remain fundamental winners, yet valuation outcomes now hinge on utilization durability, supply normalization pace, and customer concentration risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Call C — Inference economics is now the strategic battleground.</strong> Routing, distillation, quantization, caching, and hybrid cloud/edge design are direct margin levers. Teams that ignore this will grow revenue and still disappoint on free cash flow quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Call D — Pilot-to-production conversion is the most important demand KPI in 2026.</strong> Contract announcements matter less than expansion cohorts, seat activation, usage depth, and renewal economics.</li>
        <li><strong>Call E — Geopolitics and power availability are first-order variables.</strong> Export controls, packaging bottlenecks, and grid constraints are not background noise; they are potential regime shifts for earnings and multiples.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Implications for listed ecosystem names</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>NVDA / AVGO / TSM (+ optics, memory, networking chains):</strong> still core beneficiaries, but upside/downside asymmetry depends on booking visibility and whether demand broadens beyond top hyperscalers.</li>
        <li><strong>MSFT / GOOG / AMZN / META / ORCL:</strong> capex is now so large that investors require clearer AI revenue attribution and incremental margin logic.</li>
        <li><strong>IBM / PLTR / enterprise AI specialists:</strong> real opportunity if they prove repeatable production deployments in regulated sectors with outcome-linked pricing.</li>
        <li><strong>AAPL:</strong> a quieter but potentially high-quality path if on-device + private-cloud AI reinforces premium ecosystem retention rather than chasing raw model spectacle.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(2) Industry map by value chain</h2>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Layer</th><th>What it does</th><th>Who is exposed</th><th>Current profit pool quality</th><th>Fragility points</th></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Compute</strong></td><td>GPU/ASIC, foundry, advanced packaging (CoWoS), HBM, networking, optical interconnect, power/cooling</td><td>NVDA, AVGO, TSM, memory names, optics/network suppliers</td><td>High absolute dollars; tight supply at frontier nodes</td><td>Customer concentration, packaging constraints, policy shocks, eventual utilization normalization</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Model layer</strong></td><td>Foundation models, orchestration, safety, alignment, eval stacks</td><td>Frontier labs + hyperscaler model stacks</td><td>Strategic importance high; standalone monetization mixed</td><td>Rapid capability diffusion, pricing compression on “good enough” tasks</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Software / apps</strong></td><td>Copilots, workflow automation, vertical assistants, developer/data copilots</td><td>MSFT, GOOG, Salesforce-style stacks, PLTR/vertical AI players</td><td>Most promising for durable margin if integrated into existing workflows</td><td>Feature parity, weak differentiation, low switching costs for wrapper apps</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Enterprise services</strong></td><td>Integration, change management, governance, MLOps/LLMOps implementation</td><td>Consulting/SI networks + enterprise platform partners</td><td>Demand resilient in regulated industries</td><td>Labor-heavy execution, lumpy project revenue, pressure toward outcome-based fees</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h3>How value is migrating</h3>
      <p>2023–2025: value concentrated in scarce compute and frontier model novelty.</p>
      <p>2026 onward: value broadens toward <strong>workflow owners</strong> that combine: (i) distribution, (ii) governance trust, (iii) low incremental serving cost, and (iv) enterprise integration depth.</p>

      <h3>Strategic takeaway</h3>
      <p>The strongest moats are increasingly <strong>cross-layer</strong>: cloud + model + identity + data + workflow + auditability. Single-layer players without distribution or ecosystem control face faster commoditization risk.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(3) Demand analysis: enterprise adoption, consumer uptake, pricing power, pilot → production</h2>
      <h3>Enterprise demand is real, but selective</h3>
      <p>Enterprise AI is now beyond exploration stage. The hard part is scaling with governance and economic proof. Survey and field evidence suggest broad usage is rising, while “value realization at scale” remains uneven. This is classic transition behavior: adoption leads monetization quality by 12–24 months.</p>

      <h3>Where production conversion is strongest</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Customer support/service:</strong> summarization, triage, guided responses, quality assurance loops.</li>
        <li><strong>Developer productivity:</strong> code generation/review/test acceleration in mature engineering orgs.</li>
        <li><strong>Document-heavy regulated workflows:</strong> claims, onboarding/KYC, contract review, compliance drafting.</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise knowledge retrieval:</strong> permission-aware search tied to actual systems of record.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Where demand is still fragile</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Generic “chat over everything” deployments with weak integration and unclear accountability.</li>
        <li>Autonomous-agent promises where exception handling still requires expensive human backstops.</li>
        <li>Consumer paid plans with novelty usage but low habit depth.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Pricing power</h3>
      <p>Pricing power exists when AI is tied to hard outcomes (time saved, conversion gain, error reduction, compliance pass rates). It weakens when AI is sold as undifferentiated text generation. The practical pricing curve in 2026 likely looks like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>High power:</strong> regulated or mission-critical workflow automation.</li>
        <li><strong>Medium power:</strong> embedded productivity copilots inside existing enterprise contracts.</li>
        <li><strong>Low power:</strong> standalone generic assistants/wrapper apps.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Pilot-to-production conversion economics</h3>
      <p>The right KPI is not “number of pilots.” It is <strong>production conversion with expansion</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pilot conversion rate within 2 quarters</li>
        <li>90-day active usage depth by role/function</li>
        <li>Renewal + net expansion adjusted for inference cost</li>
        <li>Share of AI revenue booked in operating budgets vs innovation budgets</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Analyst view:</strong> companies reporting these metrics transparently should command higher quality multiples than peers reporting only top-line “AI seat count” headlines.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(4) Supply analysis: chips, packaging, cloud capacity, power/energy, talent</h2>
      <h3>Chips and packaging</h3>
      <p>Frontier accelerator demand remains robust, but the constraint has moved beyond chip design into <strong>advanced packaging and memory ecosystem throughput</strong>. CoWoS and HBM still act as practical throttles for high-end AI server rollout. This benefits leaders with coordinated supply-chain access and hurts smaller buyers lacking priority allocation.</p>

      <h3>Cloud capacity and buildout cycle</h3>
      <p>Hyperscaler capex trajectories have reset structurally upward. The core debate is no longer “will they spend?” but “can utilization and monetization absorb this spend with acceptable returns?” In practical terms, three questions matter most:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>How quickly does new capacity fill with paying workloads?</li>
        <li>What fraction is productive AI demand versus strategic overbuild?</li>
        <li>How much gross margin pressure comes from passing through inference costs?</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Power and energy as binding constraints</h3>
      <p>Power density is becoming a hard bottleneck in key regions. Data center expansion now requires synchronized progress in generation, transmission, cooling, and permitting. In several markets, available megawatts can decide deployment pace as much as chip availability. This introduces a new layer of regional dispersion in AI capacity growth and cost structures.</p>

      <h3>Talent bottlenecks</h3>
      <p>Top-tier model researchers remain scarce, but the larger bottleneck in 2026 is <strong>implementation talent</strong>: platform engineers, security/governance architects, MLOps/LLMOps operators, and domain workflow designers who can ship reliable production systems.</p>

      <h3>Bottom line on supply</h3>
      <p>Supply is improving versus peak scarcity, but not “frictionless.” The industry is moving from an obvious bottleneck phase (GPU shortage headlines) to a subtler bottleneck phase (power, packaging, systems integration, organizational capability).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(5) Technology frontier and practical breakthroughs: hype vs monetization</h2>
      <h3>What is monetizing now</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Workflow copilots with measurable ROI</strong> (coding, service ops, document processing).</li>
        <li><strong>Retrieval + policy-aware enterprise agents</strong> in constrained domains.</li>
        <li><strong>Inference optimization stack</strong> (distillation, quantization, routing) that directly lowers COGS.</li>
        <li><strong>Multimodal in practical settings</strong> (voice support, image/document intake, industrial inspection).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What is still mostly hype (for now)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Claims of broad, reliable, unattended autonomous agents across messy enterprise processes.</li>
        <li>Benchmark-centric narratives with weak translation into production reliability metrics.</li>
        <li>Consumer-facing AI features with high demo value but low recurring utility.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Frontier developments to watch</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Reasoning + tool use quality in constrained production loops</strong> (not open-ended chat).</li>
        <li><strong>Small/high-efficiency models at edge and private environments</strong> for latency, privacy, and cost control.</li>
        <li><strong>Model governance infrastructure</strong> (auditing, eval pipelines, policy orchestration, red-team automation).</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Analyst view:</strong> The market is underpricing “boring AI plumbing” and overpricing headline demos. The next winners are likely to look operationally disciplined rather than theatrically revolutionary.</p>

      <h2>(6) Competitive dynamics and moats by segment</h2>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Segment</th><th>Primary moat candidates</th><th>Likely moat decay vectors</th><th>Assessment</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Compute platforms</td><td>Software ecosystem lock-in, developer tooling, system-level integration, customer roadmaps</td><td>Custom silicon adoption, alternative ecosystems, pricing pressure if supply eases</td><td><strong>Strong now</strong>, but monitor concentration and substitution pace</td></tr>

      </table>

      <h3>Moat hierarchy for 2026</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Distribution + workflow ownership</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Cost-efficient serving + reliability</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory/compliance trust infrastructure</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Raw model frontier scores</strong> (important, but less monetizable alone)</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(7) Financial architecture: capex intensity, unit economics, margin durability, cash-flow quality</h2>
      <h3>Capex intensity regime has changed</h3>
      <p>AI has pushed large platform capex into a new band. This can create durable strategic advantage, but only if downstream monetization catches up. Investors should separate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Capex that scales profitable demand</strong> (good spend), from</li>
        <li><strong>Capex that pre-empts competition without clear utilization path</strong> (optionality spend with uncertain returns).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Unit economics framework (practical)</h3>
      <p>For any AI product, ask:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Revenue per active user/workflow per month</li>
        <li>Variable inference + retrieval + orchestration cost per active unit</li>
        <li>Gross margin at current usage depth and at 2x usage depth</li>
        <li>Support/governance overhead per enterprise deployment</li>
        <li>Payback period after implementation costs</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Margin durability</h3>
      <p>Margin durability in AI software depends less on headline pricing and more on <strong>cost discipline + stickiness</strong>. A company can keep list prices stable and still destroy margin if high-value workloads are not routed efficiently.</p>

      <h3>Cash-flow quality in this cycle</h3>
      <p>In 2026, market quality premium should go to companies with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear AI revenue attribution</li>
        <li>Stable or improving incremental gross margin</li>
        <li>Operating cash flow growth not entirely lease/capex-engineered</li>
        <li>Evidence of repeatable expansion in production cohorts</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Analyst view:</strong> “AI growth” without cash-flow quality should de-rate faster in this stage of the cycle than in 2024–2025.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(8) Geopolitics and export-control scenario analysis</h2>
      <h3>Why this is now a core valuation input</h3>
      <p>Export controls and technology sovereignty policies can reshape TAM, supply chain routing, and product cadence. The market still tends to underprice policy discontinuity risk until a rule is implemented.</p>

      <h3>Three geopolitics scenarios</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Description</th><th>Likely winners</th><th>Likely pressure points</th></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Managed tension (base)</strong></td><td>Controls tighten gradually, licensing pathways remain selective, no abrupt systemic freeze</td><td>Players with diversified geography and compliance-ready sales motion</td><td>Mid-tier global buyers with uncertain access windows</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Hard fragmentation</strong></td><td>Broader restrictions on advanced chips/tools + reciprocal constraints</td><td>Domestic champions in each bloc; sovereign cloud providers</td><td>Global supply-chain efficiency; cross-border model deployment</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Partial thaw</strong></td><td>Targeted relaxations for specific categories under strict safeguards</td><td>Large vendors with legal/compliance execution muscle</td><td>Narratives built on permanent scarcity premium</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Portfolio implication</h3>
      <p>Treat geopolitical risk as a position-sizing problem, not just a news risk. Exposure concentration in a single chokepoint (foundry geography, packaging lane, licensing regime) warrants explicit risk budget treatment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(9) Policy/regulatory landscape and likely pathways</h2>
      <h3>Regulation is converging on deployment accountability</h3>
      <p>Across major regions, policy focus is shifting from abstract AI ethics to enforceable obligations: risk classification, documentation, transparency, model/system controls, and sector-specific liability standards.</p>

      <h3>What likely matters most for economics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Compliance overhead becomes a scale moat.</strong> Large incumbents can absorb governance cost better than smaller competitors.</li>
        <li><strong>Auditability requirements raise barriers for low-cost “fast ship” players.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Data provenance and usage rights become commercial as well as legal constraints.</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Likely pathway (2026 view)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>More concrete enforcement guidance in high-risk and GPAI-adjacent categories</li>
        <li>Higher enterprise demand for vendor indemnification, traceability, and incident response clauses</li>
        <li>Regulatory divergence by region, requiring product localization and legal architecture by market</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Analyst view:</strong> Regulatory burden is not purely negative. It can improve market structure by favoring serious operators with governance infrastructure and reducing low-quality supply.</p>

      <h3>What would make me more bullish</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Consistent evidence that AI workloads are moving from experiment budgets to recurring operating budgets.</li>
        <li>Clear gross-margin resilience despite rising AI usage.</li>
        <li>Broader demand beyond top hyperscaler concentration in compute supply chains.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What would change my mind to bearish</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Persistent gap between AI capex growth and monetization quality for 2–3 reporting cycles.</li>
        <li>Material increase in regulatory/geopolitical frictions that reduce global addressable demand.</li>
        <li>Evidence that inference price compression is not offset by usage depth or workflow stickiness.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bottom-line positioning logic</h3>
      <p>Stay constructive on AI as a structural trend, but avoid treating the ecosystem as one trade. Prioritize businesses where AI economics are becoming <strong>visible, repeatable, and cash-generative</strong>. Be skeptical of stories that require perfect policy, perfect supply chains, and perfect customer behavior to justify valuation.</p>
