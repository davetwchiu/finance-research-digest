<h1>AI Industry Research Notebook</h1>
<p class='muted'>This is the full-length AI industry research notebook (market trend, technology breakthroughs, demand/supply, capex, geopolitics, and strategic implications). Updated by automation.</p>

<div class='card'>
<h2>Executive Thesis</h2>
<p>AI remains in a capex-heavy buildout phase where value capture is uneven across compute, models, software, and enterprise integration layers. Near-term upside depends on monetization proof and demand durability under a potentially tighter policy/trade backdrop.</p>
</div>

<div class='card'>
<h2>1) Market Trend</h2>
<p>Market currently prices AI as both a productivity supercycle and a valuation-sensitive crowded trade. Dispersion is increasing between infrastructure winners and narrative-only names.</p>
</div>

<div class='card'>
<h2>2) Latest Tech / Breakthroughs</h2>
<p>Key frontier themes: model efficiency gains, inference optimization, enterprise workflow integration, and stack-level cost compression. Breakthroughs matter most when they shift unit economics, not just benchmark scores.</p>
</div>

<div class='card'>
<h2>3) Demand & Supply</h2>
<p>Demand signals: sustained enterprise pilots converting to production, hyperscaler spend discipline, and backlog quality. Supply constraints remain concentrated in advanced packaging, power, and talent bottlenecks.</p>
</div>

<div class='card'>
<h2>4) Risk Matrix</h2>
<ul>
<li>Capex-to-revenue mismatch risk if monetization lags.</li>
<li>Geopolitical/export-control risk across semiconductor and cloud supply chains.</li>
<li>Regulatory/compliance risk around model deployment and data governance.</li>
<li>Competitive compression risk as model costs fall and differentiation shifts upward.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class='card'>
<h2>5) Strategic View (Analyst Opinion)</h2>
<p>Favor companies with durable distribution, pricing power, and demonstrated conversion from AI spend to cash flow. Be cautious on stories where valuation is ahead of evidence. Treat AI as a multi-year platform shift but manage entry timing with macro/liquidity discipline.</p>
