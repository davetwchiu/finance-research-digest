    <h1>AI Industry Research Notebook (In-Depth)</h1>
    <p class="muted">Prepared for David • Tuesday, 24 Feb 2026 (09:30 HKT reference) • Plain-language long-form research with explicit analyst calls, scenario trees, and falsifiable signposts.</p>

      <h2>How to use this notebook</h2>
      <p>This is built as a decision notebook, not a headline digest. It is intentionally long-form for a ~30–45 minute read. The objective is to separate <strong>narrative momentum</strong> from <strong>cash-flow reality</strong>, then map where value capture is most durable across the AI stack.</p>
      <div class="kpi">
        <div>
          <span class="pill bull">Primary call</span><br/>
          AI remains a real platform transition, but 2026 returns will be more selective: the market is moving from benchmark excitement to production economics.
        </div>
        <div>
          <span class="pill warn">Base case</span><br/>
          The next leg is decided by pilot-to-production conversion, inference unit economics, and governance-enabled enterprise rollouts.
        </div>
        <div>
          <span class="pill bear">Main downside</span><br/>
          If capex keeps rising while AI revenue quality lags, both infrastructure and application layers can de-rate at the same time.

      <h2>(1) Executive thesis and key calls</h2>
      <h3>Executive thesis</h3>
      <p>The AI industry is entering a harder phase: from <strong>scarcity-led growth</strong> to <strong>discipline-led growth</strong>. In 2023–2025, leadership was defined by who could secure accelerators, announce model upgrades, and claim ecosystem momentum. In 2026, leadership will be defined by who can show that AI revenue is recurring, margin-resilient, and not purely subsidy-driven.</p>
      <p>My core view: <strong>the strongest winners over the next 12 months are not necessarily the labs with the highest headline benchmark scores; they are firms with distribution power, workflow ownership, and lower cost-to-serve per useful output.</strong></p>

      <h3>Strong analyst calls</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Call #1 — Value capture broadens from pure compute to workflow owners.</strong> Infrastructure remains critical (NVDA, AVGO, TSM, LITE ecosystem), but incremental upside increasingly shifts toward platforms with installed distribution and cross-product AI upsell (MSFT, GOOG, enterprise software leaders).</li>
        <li><strong>Call #2 — Model quality leadership still matters, but quality alone is a weaker moat.</strong> Top labs keep an edge; however, many enterprise tasks now clear a “good enough” threshold, weakening standalone premium pricing without integrated distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Call #3 — Inference economics is the new battlefield.</strong> Gross margin durability now depends on routing, caching, quantization, model selection, and product design that suppresses low-value token burn.</li>
        <li><strong>Call #4 — 2026 is a conversion year, not a pilot year.</strong> Buyers are less impressed by demos, more focused on productivity proof, error handling, governance overhead, and operating-budget adoption.</li>
        <li><strong>Call #5 — Geopolitics is a valuation input, not a side note.</strong> Export control shifts, sovereign cloud requirements, and power-grid realities can alter supply assumptions and demand addressability faster than normal cycle models assume.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Implications for listed AI ecosystem names</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>NVDA / AVGO / TSM / LITE:</strong> structurally advantaged but now judged against very high expectations; beat quality and forward visibility matter more than revenue growth headlines alone.</li>
        <li><strong>MSFT / GOOG / IBM:</strong> judged on whether AI is additive to margin and wallet share, or mostly a defense spend to protect core franchises.</li>
        <li><strong>AAPL:</strong> edge strategy (on-device AI + ecosystem lock-in) can be lower headline excitement but potentially higher long-run economic quality if it drives retention and premium pricing.</li>
        <li><strong>PLTR / BBAI and similar AI software narratives:</strong> multiple expansion needs repeatable production economics, not contract announcement velocity.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(2) Industry map by value chain (compute, models, software/apps, enterprise services)</h2>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Value-chain layer</th>
          <th>Function</th>
          <th>Representative ecosystem names</th>

          <td>Enterprise trust, reliability, integration with cloud/security stack</td>
          <td>Commoditization in mid-tier workloads, high inference burn without product moat</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Software / Apps</strong></td>
          <td>Copilots, workflow automation, AI-native features in SaaS, developer and data tooling</td>
          <td>MSFT, GOOG workspace stack, IBM enterprise automation, PLTR, vertical software specialists</td>
          <td>Installed base upsell, low incremental CAC, workflow lock-in</td>

        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Cross-layer control is the emerging moat</h3>
      <p>The most defensible players coordinate across multiple layers, not one. Compute without software distribution can become cyclical. Model leadership without enterprise channels can become expensive. Application innovation without data and governance integration can remain low stickiness. The best economics come from <strong>cross-layer orchestration</strong>: cloud + model + identity + workflow + auditability.</p>

      <h3>Where each segment likely captures value over 12 months</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Compute:</strong> strong absolute dollars, but valuation sensitivity to any demand normalization signal.</li>
        <li><strong>Models:</strong> strategic influence remains high; standalone monetization dispersion widens.</li>
        <li><strong>Software/apps:</strong> largest upside from ROI-linked production usage and expansion cohorts.</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise services:</strong> stable demand but margin quality depends on automation leverage, not headcount growth.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(3) Demand analysis (enterprise adoption, consumer uptake, pricing power, pilot → production)</h2>
      <h3>Enterprise adoption: procurement discipline replaces experimentation theater</h3>
      <p>Large enterprises are no longer asking “Should we do AI?” They are asking “Which workflows justify operating-budget deployment under compliance constraints?” This sounds subtle but is a major shift. Decision ownership has moved from innovation teams to CIO/CFO/legal triads, and spending approval now requires measurable productivity deltas.</p>

      <h3>Where enterprise demand is real and sticky</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Customer operations:</strong> AI-assisted triage, summarization, and next-best-action tools are reducing handling time and improving consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Software delivery:</strong> coding copilots show gains when engineering standards are mature and review pipelines are strict.</li>
        <li><strong>Document-heavy workflows:</strong> claims, compliance checks, contract analysis, onboarding/KYC, and regulated reporting pipelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Internal search/knowledge:</strong> permission-aware retrieval and enterprise memory tooling with observability.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Where demand is weaker than headlines imply</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Generic enterprise chat assistants with weak integration into business systems.</li>
        <li>“Fully autonomous” workflows where exception handling still requires heavy human intervention.</li>
        <li>Consumer AI subscriptions with limited post-trial retention unless tied to existing ecosystem utility.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Consumer uptake: broad awareness, uneven willingness to pay</h3>
      <p>Consumer usage is wide; consumer paid retention is narrower. The market is split between:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Utility-centered demand:</strong> users who repeatedly use AI for work, school, creator workflows, or planning.</li>
        <li><strong>Novelty-centered demand:</strong> users who engage intermittently and churn when novelty fades.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Implication: consumer AI pricing power exists, but mainly when embedded in a larger platform habit (productivity suite, device ecosystem, social graph, creator tooling). Standalone apps face churn gravity.</p>

      <h3>Pricing power and monetization mechanics</h3>
      <p>Pricing power is strongest when AI is attached to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>mission-critical workflow outcomes (time saved, error reduction, conversion gain),</li>
        <li>compliance requirements (audit trail, policy enforcement),</li>
        <li>and low-friction deployment through existing vendor contracts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Pricing power weakens when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>alternatives are “good enough,”</li>
        <li>switching costs are low,</li>
        <li>or AI value is hard to attribute in procurement language.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Pilot-to-production conversion: the 2026 KPI that matters most</h3>
      <p>A healthy conversion pipeline usually has: scoped use case, baseline KPI, governance owner, integration plan, and budget migration to recurring operating spend. A weak pipeline has: perpetual sandbox pilots, unclear owners, and no IT/security signoff path.</p>
      <p><strong>Hard view:</strong> firms that keep citing “pipeline and interest” without conversion cohorts should be discounted. Pipeline without production is marketing, not economics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(4) Supply analysis (chips, packaging, cloud capacity, power/energy, talent bottlenecks)</h2>
      <h3>Chips and advanced packaging</h3>
      <p>The pure “GPU unavailable” panic has eased relative to early-cycle stress, but bottlenecks remain in top-end cluster readiness: advanced packaging throughput, high-bandwidth memory, networking fabric balance, and rack-level power/cooling delivery. The practical bottleneck is no longer buying a single component; it is deploying integrated clusters at target utilization.</p>

      <h3>Cloud capacity and utilization quality</h3>
      <p>Hyperscaler capacity expansion has been aggressive. The next question is utilization quality, not capacity count. If workload mix skews toward low-margin inference or internal subsidy usage, headline growth can mask weaker economics. Investors should track utilization commentary plus incremental gross margin behavior.</p>

      <h3>Power and grid realities</h3>
      <p>Power has become a strategic input to AI growth. New data-center projects now hinge on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>grid interconnect lead times,</li>
        <li>local permitting speed,</li>
        <li>cooling architecture suitability,</li>
        <li>and long-duration energy contracting.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This creates second-order beneficiaries (power equipment, cooling, grid modernization) and a risk premium on regions with infrastructure bottlenecks.</p>

      <h3>Talent bottlenecks are shifting</h3>
      <p>Scarcity has shifted from pure model researchers to execution talent: inference optimization engineers, AI product managers, governance/security architects, and domain specialists capable of redesigning workflows. This favors platform-heavy firms (MSFT, GOOG, IBM, PLTR-style deep-integration setups) over teams relying on outsourced integration alone.</p>

      <h3>Implications for listed names</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>NVDA/AVGO/TSM:</strong> still structurally central but increasingly judged on supply durability plus customer capex sustainability.</li>
        <li><strong>LITE and networking/optics chain:</strong> sensitive to sustained cluster buildout quality; watch order cadence and inventory normalization risks.</li>
        <li><strong>MSFT/GOOG:</strong> cloud capacity advantage is meaningful only if AI workloads preserve margin quality over time.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(5) Technology frontier and practical breakthroughs (hype vs monetizing)</h2>
      <h3>What still looks like hype</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Benchmark theater:</strong> narrow score gains marketed as broad economic breakthroughs.</li>
        <li><strong>Autonomy overreach:</strong> claims of fully autonomous enterprise agents without robust exception and audit handling.</li>
        <li><strong>Universal model narratives:</strong> real-world production stacks are increasingly multi-model and route by task economics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What is clearly monetizing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inference efficiency stack:</strong> quantization, distillation, dynamic routing, caching, speculative decoding, and workload-aware serving.</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise retrieval and data control:</strong> permissioning, lineage, source confidence scoring, and policy enforcement.</li>
        <li><strong>Workflow-native UX:</strong> AI integrated inside existing interfaces, reducing context switching and increasing adoption durability.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance-first deployment tooling:</strong> observability, audit logs, and policy guardrails accelerating enterprise approvals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Frontier themes by commercialization readiness</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Theme</th><th>Commercial readiness (12m)</th><th>Near-term monetization path</th><th>Main execution risk</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Reasoning + tool-use reliability improvements</td><td>High</td><td>Higher-value enterprise tasks and coding workflows</td><td>Cost creep if reasoning depth is unconstrained</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Agent orchestration with deterministic controls</td><td>Medium-High</td><td>Back-office automation and ops runbooks</td><td>Exception management complexity</td></tr>
        <tr><td>On-device AI acceleration</td><td>Medium</td><td>Device lock-in, privacy-sensitive workloads, latency gains</td><td>Fragmented hardware/software standards</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Video and synthetic media generation</td><td>Medium</td><td>Marketing and creator tooling</td><td>Copyright/licensing uncertainty and quality consistency</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Analyst judgment</h3>
      <p>The market still overprices “capability surprise” and underprices “operational reliability.” In enterprise deployments, reliability and governance are revenue accelerants. The firm that can be trusted in production beats the firm that only demos well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(6) Competitive dynamics and moats by segment</h2>
      <h3>Compute segment: ecosystem and integration moat</h3>
      <p>Compute moats combine software tooling, developer familiarity, system-level integration, and manufacturing relationships. Hardware performance matters, but customer switching risk is highest when software stack migration is expensive. This is why ecosystem lock-in can sustain premium economics even under rising competition.</p>

      <h3>Model segment: trust + distribution moat</h3>
      <p>Model quality remains necessary but no longer sufficient. Durable advantage comes from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>enterprise trust (safety, reliability, contractual standards),</li>
        <li>distribution reach (cloud channels, software suites, developer ecosystems),</li>
        <li>and cost discipline at scale.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Without distribution, model excellence can become a high-burn commodity business.</p>

      <h3>Software/apps segment: workflow ownership moat</h3>
      <p>The strongest software moat is ownership of frequent workflows and embedded context (identity, permissions, historical enterprise data). Vendors that only expose generic chat interfaces are vulnerable to feature parity. Vendors that redesign workflow states (approve, route, escalate, audit) become sticky.</p>

      <h3>Enterprise services: relationship and delivery moat</h3>
      <p>Services firms retain power through trust and execution at scale, but face pressure to prove outcome-linked value rather than billable-hour growth. Best-in-class firms combine domain expertise with reusable AI accelerators; laggards stay labor-heavy.</p>

      <h3>Competitive pressure points to watch</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bundling wars among hyperscalers and productivity suites.</li>
        <li>Custom silicon programs at cloud providers reducing dependence on third-party accelerator pricing.</li>
        <li>Open-weight and lower-cost models compressing standalone API price bands.</li>
        <li>Vertical SaaS incumbents embedding AI faster than AI-native startups expected.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bottom line</h3>
      <p>AI moat durability is now <strong>systems durability</strong>. Distribution + data gravity + governance + workflow integration is more defensible than any single benchmark lead.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(7) Financial architecture (capex intensity, unit economics, margin durability, cash-flow quality)</h2>
      <h3>Capex intensity: necessary but not self-justifying</h3>
      <p>AI capex remains elevated across hyperscalers and ecosystem suppliers. The analytical mistake is treating high capex as automatic evidence of future moat. Capex creates option value only if it converts to durable high-quality revenue. A practical lens is <strong>capex to incremental gross profit</strong>, not raw capex growth.</p>

      <h3>Unit economics checklist for AI businesses</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Revenue quality:</strong> recurring production usage vs project-based one-offs.</li>
        <li><strong>Price realization:</strong> list price vs discount-heavy negotiated outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage efficiency:</strong> cost per successful task/output, not just cost per token.</li>
        <li><strong>Support burden:</strong> human-in-the-loop, safety review, and exception-handling overhead.</li>
        <li><strong>Churn profile:</strong> retention after initial novelty period or pilot completion.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Margin durability by layer</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Layer</th><th>Near-term margin outlook</th><th>Key determinant</th><th>Main threat</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Compute</td><td>Strong but sensitive to cycle perception</td><td>Utilization + supply discipline</td><td>Demand normalization and customer concentration</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Model APIs</td><td>Mixed / compressive bias for generic workloads</td><td>Efficiency gains vs price erosion</td><td>Commoditization of non-differentiated tasks</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Workflow software</td><td>Potentially expanding if AI drives net retention</td><td>Embedded ROI and low CAC upsell</td><td>Feature parity and discounting pressure</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Services</td><td>Stable-to-moderate</td><td>Reuse automation and delivery leverage</td><td>Labor intensity and pricing pressure</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Cash-flow quality signals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Rising free-cash-flow conversion alongside AI revenue expansion.</li>
        <li>Renewal cohorts expanding usage without escalating discount intensity.</li>
        <li>Operating expense discipline despite rapid AI feature rollout.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Red flags</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>High AI narrative intensity with weak measurable contribution to operating cash flow.</li>
        <li>Persistent bundling opacity that obscures true AI willingness-to-pay.</li>
        <li>Capitalized development practices that flatten apparent cost profile.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Hard stance:</strong> In this phase, “AI story + weak cash conversion” should carry a valuation penalty. Liquidity can support narratives temporarily; cash-flow quality decides durability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>(8) Geopolitics and export-control scenario analysis</h2>
      <h3>Core geopolitical vectors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>US and allied controls on advanced chips, tooling, and cloud access pathways.</li>
        <li>China acceleration of domestic substitution across semis, AI software, and infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Sovereign cloud and data localization requirements across Europe, Middle East, and APAC jurisdictions.</li>
        <li>Retaliation channels: procurement preference shifts, materials leverage, and regulatory asymmetry.</li>

      <h3>12-month scenario grid</h3>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Probability</th><th>Operational impact</th><th>Likely equity reaction</th></tr>

      <h3>Name-level implications</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>TSM and advanced manufacturing chain:</strong> geopolitical risk premium remains structurally embedded in valuation frameworks.</li>
        <li><strong>NVDA/AVGO ecosystem:</strong> policy-driven customer mix and shipment pathways can alter growth slope assumptions quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Hyperscalers (MSFT/GOOG):</strong> sovereign cloud strategy becomes a competitive differentiator, not just compliance overhead.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Practical modeling recommendation: use explicit geopolitical discounts in terminal assumptions rather than burying risk in generic multiple compression.</p>

      <h2>(9) Policy/regulatory landscape and likely pathways</h2>
      <h3>What regulation is becoming</h3>
      <p>Policy is shifting from high-level principles to enforceable operational standards. Focus areas include model risk management, data provenance, safety testing expectations, sector-specific controls, synthetic media disclosure, and legal accountability boundaries for generated outputs.</p>

      <h3>Likely 12-month pathway</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Sector implementation:</strong> finance, healthcare, government procurement will set practical templates first.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation burden rises:</strong> audit trails, model cards, decision logs, and incident-reporting standards become table stakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Procurement filters tighten:</strong> large enterprises increasingly require governance capabilities before pilot expansion.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Commercial consequence</h3>
      <p>Compliance capabilities are becoming a revenue accelerator. Vendors with robust governance tooling close larger deals faster. Vendors treating compliance as afterthought face slower sales cycles and lower trust-weighted win rates.</p>

      <h3>Investment lens</h3>
      <p>Regulation is not uniformly bearish. It can entrench incumbents with stronger legal, security, and audit capabilities. The key is whether regulation raises barriers to entry in ways that favor your target company’s operating model.</p>

      <h2>(11) Scenario tree for next 3 / 6 / 12 months with signposts</h2>
      <h3>3 months: “evidence checkpoint”</h3>
      <p><strong>Base (55%):</strong> infra demand remains healthy, software monetization uneven, market rewards names with clear production metrics.<br/>
      <strong>Bull (25%):</strong> broad improvement in enterprise conversion and margin guidance; risk appetite expands.<br/>
      <strong>Bear (20%):</strong> mixed demand plus margin caution leads to multiple compression in high-expectation AI names.</p>
      <p><strong>Signposts:</strong> attach-rate disclosures, pilot-to-production commentary, realized AI pricing vs discount levels, and gross margin trends in AI-heavy cohorts.</p>

      <h3>6 months: “economics sorting”</h3>
      <p><strong>Base (50%):</strong> valuation dispersion widens: cash-converting operators outperform narrative peers.<br/>
      <strong>Bull (30%):</strong> cost-per-output falls faster than price erosion; margins expand in software + resilient in infra.<br/>
      <strong>Bear (20%):</strong> enterprise budget fatigue and competitive discounting pressure both revenue quality and margins.</p>
      <p><strong>Signposts:</strong> renewal quality, expansion cohorts, cloud utilization quality, and sustained FCF conversion.</p>

      <h3>12 months: “moat reset”</h3>
      <p><strong>Base (45%):</strong> clear leadership cluster emerges around cross-layer control and governance-first deployment models.<br/>
      <strong>Bull (30%):</strong> AI productivity cycle broadens beyond early adopter verticals; earnings revisions move higher.<br/>
      <strong>Bear (25%):</strong> geopolitical/regulatory shock plus macro cooling delays enterprise scaling and pressures valuations.</p>
      <p><strong>Signposts:</strong> multi-quarter cash-flow quality, regulatory operating clarity, supply-chain stability, and enterprise seat/usage expansion persistence.</p>

      <h3>Tree logic summary</h3>
      <p>The most probable path is not collapse or euphoria. It is a sorting regime where execution quality matters disproportionately. The right stance is selective conviction with explicit kill-criteria, not blanket AI beta.</p>

      <h3>What would change my mind (explicit falsifiers)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I become more bullish fast</strong> if enterprise conversion broadens beyond a few flagship accounts and AI gross margins improve despite competitive pricing pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>I become more defensive</strong> if two consecutive reporting cycles show elevated AI capex with weak incremental free-cash-flow conversion.</li>
        <li><strong>I raise conviction on model-layer economics</strong> if leading providers sustain pricing power without heavy bundling and demonstrate persistent cost-to-serve improvements.</li>
        <li><strong>I reduce infra cyclicality concern</strong> if supply normalization happens with stable utilization and no sharp pricing retracement.</li>
        <li><strong>I reassess geopolitical discount</strong> if policy trajectory becomes structurally more predictable for cross-border AI supply and cloud operations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Action framework for David’s workflow</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> rank AI ecosystem names by conversion quality + cash-flow quality + geopolitical sensitivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Earnings season:</strong> prioritize transcript evidence over headline growth (attach rates, renewal quality, cost curves).</li>
        <li><strong>When volatility spikes:</strong> separate demand shock from valuation shock; add only where unit economics remain intact.</li>
        <li><strong>Portfolio hygiene:</strong> keep scenario-based position sizing; avoid concentration in names where thesis depends on one fragile assumption (policy, one customer, one product cycle).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Final synthesis</h2>
      <p>AI is not ending; it is normalizing. Normalization is where weak narratives fade and strong operating systems compound. The edge now is not predicting the loudest launch — it is identifying who can repeatedly turn compute and models into trusted, embedded, paid workflow outcomes with improving economics.</p>
      <p><strong>One-line conclusion:</strong> 2026 is the year AI stops being a “story trade” and becomes an “execution trade.” Stay long the operators, not the slogans.</p>
