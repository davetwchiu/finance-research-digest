Scenario tree, cross-asset linkage, and monitoring checklist.</p>
<div class='card'><h2>Executive frame: regime first, stock picks second</h2><p>The market regime entering this session remains selective rather than indiscriminately bullish. Equity indices can still grind higher, but transmission from macro to portfolio returns is increasingly nonlinear: identical earnings narratives are producing very different price outcomes depending on rates, liquidity quality, and policy tone. For David’s style—calculated risk with scenario discipline—the correct posture is not “risk-on vs risk-off” in absolute terms, but conditional risk-on with explicit de-risk triggers. The edge is execution quality under uncertainty, not prediction confidence.</p>
<p>Three top-down variables should dominate decision weight over the next month. First is the direction and speed of real yields, especially long-end U.S. rates, because your watchlist is duration sensitive. Second is policy friction around trade controls, strategic industrial policy, and defense procurement cadence, which directly affects semiconductor supply chains and mission-tech revenue timing. Third is breadth quality: whether participation broadens beyond index concentration. If breadth fails while indices stay resilient, tactical drawdown risk can rise even when headlines look benign.</p>
<p>Portfolio implication: keep core compounders as structural anchors, but require harder evidence to add aggressively to higher-fragility names. This is a regime where position sizing and sequencing drive outcomes more than raw idea generation.</p></div>
<div class='card'><h2>Macro and policy transmission map</h2><p><strong>Rates channel.</strong> A 20–30bp move in long-end real yields can dominate near-term valuation outcomes for semis, software, and high-duration innovators. Falling real yields with stable credit spreads usually supports multiple expansion and cleaner breakout follow-through. Rising real yields with a firm USD usually compresses expensive growth cohorts first, then spills into second-line tactical names with lower liquidity. In your book, this channel primarily impacts NVDA, AVGO, MSFT, GOOG, TSM, TSLA, PLTR, RKLB, RDW, and BBAI.</p>
<p><strong>Policy channel.</strong> Export controls and industrial policy are no longer background noise; they are active cash-flow path variables. For semiconductors and AI infrastructure, policy headlines can alter expected demand mix and pricing power. For defense and mission-software names, budget authorization, contract award cadence, and procurement modernization are key throughput variables from narrative to recognized revenue. Policy can be a tailwind and still generate near-term volatility when timing mismatches expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Liquidity channel.</strong> Crowding remains a latent risk. High-conviction narratives often attract momentum capital that exits quickly if cross-asset confirmation weakens. Therefore, unusual volume surges without fundamental confirmation should be interpreted as fragility signals, not automatic strength. In practical terms, volume matters most when paired with structure and evidence freshness.</p></div>
<div class='card'><h2>Scenario tree (4–8 weeks)</h2><p><strong>Base case (55%): selective risk-on, range-bound real yields.</strong> Equity leadership remains concentrated in quality growth while tactical names trade with higher variance. Portfolio action: maintain core gross exposure, add tactical risk only on confirmation days, and reserve liquidity for dislocations. Focus on evidence quality and catalyst sequencing rather than headline speed.</p>
<p><strong>Bull case (25%): disinflation confidence improves, real yields ease, breadth broadens.</strong> Market can rotate from concentrated mega-cap leadership into second-line growth and policy-linked innovation. Portfolio action: step up tactical gross in phases, prioritize names with positive signal delta and upcoming catalysts, then recycle gains into lagging high-quality names only if breadth confirms.</p>
<p><strong>Bear case (20%): term premium shock, firmer USD, harder policy rhetoric.</strong> Correlation rises, fragile names derate quickly, and “good story” names underperform despite intact long-term theses. Portfolio action: reduce highest fragility exposures first, keep ballast and core compounders, and tighten invalidation discipline to preserve optionality.</p>
<p><strong>Decision gate:</strong> increase gross risk only when at least two of three align: (1) real yields stable/down, (2) credit spreads stable, (3) breadth improving. If two of three deteriorate, cut tactical gross by rule rather than discretion.</p></div>
<div class='card'><h2>Cross-asset linkage dashboard</h2><ul><li><strong>Real yields up + USD up:</strong> valuation compression risk for duration-heavy growth; reduce add-frequency.</li><li><strong>Real yields down + spreads stable:</strong> constructive for breakout continuation; allow staged adds.</li><li><strong>Oil up + breadth weak:</strong> stagflation scare profile; treat tactical rallies as sell-into-strength.</li><li><strong>Gold up + real yields down:</strong> easing expectations; supports duration but verify with breadth.</li><li><strong>Defense-policy urgency up:</strong> relative support for KTOS/PLTR/RKLB/RDW/ONDS/BBAI, but contract timing still drives volatility.</li></ul>
<p>Interpretation rule: one signal alone is noise; aligned signals are regime evidence. This avoids whipsaw from reacting to single headline prints.</p></div>
<div class='card'><h2>Portfolio implementation rules</h2><p><strong>Core sleeve.</strong> AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, NVDA, AVGO, TSM with BRK.B/IBM ballast should remain the compounding center. Use pullbacks for accumulation only when macro gate is neutral-to-positive and technical structure remains intact.</p>
<p><strong>Tactical sleeve.</strong> PLTR, RKLB, RDW, KTOS, BBAI, ONDS, TSLA, UUUU, LITE should be run as convexity buckets with explicit catalyst clocks. Size by fragility and evidence score, not narrative strength.</p>
<p><strong>Sizing protocol.</strong> Initial entry small, add on confirmation closes with volume support (>1.2x 20D average), and scale out into event-driven spikes without evidence upgrades. Preserve 20–30% dry powder for policy/rates dislocations.</p>
<p><strong>Invalidation discipline.</strong> A thesis can stay valid while a trade becomes wrong. If macro gate weakens and a name loses structure with deteriorating signal delta, reduce without waiting for narrative certainty.</p></div>
<div class='card'><h2>Risk governance and scenario execution</h2><p>The most common failure mode in this regime is conflating thesis confidence with sizing confidence. Keep those separate. Thesis confidence evolves on quarterly evidence; sizing confidence must adapt daily to market structure, liquidity, and macro alignment. This creates stability in decision-making and lowers regret-driven behavior.</p>
<p>Use a three-level escalation map. <strong>Level 1 (Normal):</strong> mixed but stable conditions; selective adds allowed. <strong>Level 2 (Caution):</strong> one major variable deteriorates (for example, yields spike); pause adds and tighten tactical stops. <strong>Level 3 (Protect):</strong> rates, spreads, and breadth deteriorate together; actively cut fragility and protect capital. A rules-based map outperforms discretionary reaction during volatility clusters.</p>
<p>Also track opportunity cost. Over-defensiveness in confirmed bull transitions can be as damaging as over-aggression in fragile tapes. The solution is staged participation: small initial adds under uncertainty, then larger adds only after cross-asset confirmation. This preserves upside while controlling drawdown velocity.</p></div>
<div class='card'><h2>Monitoring checklist (daily)</h2><ol><li>Real yield trend and velocity (intraday and close).</li><li>Credit spread behavior vs equity tape.</li><li>Breadth quality vs index concentration.</li><li>USD direction relative to growth leadership.</li><li>Watchlist volume anomalies vs 20D average.</li><li>Catalyst countdown and risk-tag changes for next 30 days.</li><li>Evidence quality score and stale-data warnings.</li><li>Signal engine changes: state, conviction, fragility, day-over-day delta.</li><li>End-of-day journal: one evidence-upgrade and one evidence-downgrade line.</li></ol></div>
<div class='card'><h2>Deep-dive routing for this run</h2><p><strong>HIGH bucket:</strong> BRK.B, GOOG, AAPL, TSLA, NVDA</p><p><strong>Near-catalyst bucket (<=30d):</strong> None detected from exchange-linked feed</p><p><strong>Unusual-move/liquidity bucket:</strong> BBAI, TSM, UUUU</p><p><strong>Breaking-news persistence bucket (2-run rule):</strong> TSLA, IBM</p></div>
<div class='card'><h2>Extended playbook: how to run this regime day by day</h2><p>To keep execution consistent, split every trading day into three checkpoints. <strong>Checkpoint 1 (pre-open):</strong> classify the day as supportive, neutral, or hostile by checking real yields, USD tone, and overnight policy headlines. Supportive means at least two macro levers are aligned for risk assets; hostile means at least two are moving against. Neutral means mixed inputs and calls for smaller position changes. <strong>Checkpoint 2 (mid-session):</strong> verify whether volume confirms the opening move. If price direction and volume disagree, avoid adding size because false breaks are common in headline-rich sessions. <strong>Checkpoint 3 (close):</strong> evaluate whether cross-asset confirmation held through the full session. Close-to-close validation matters more than intraday excitement for multi-day positioning.</p><p>Under this structure, each position gets a role assignment before execution: core compounding, tactical convexity, or ballast. Core positions are allowed more room and are managed with slower turnover, because their objective is long-term compounding with lower decision noise. Tactical convexity positions are managed with tighter rules and lower tolerance for evidence decay. Ballast positions are not expected to win every tape; their purpose is preserving flexibility when risk assets become unstable. Role clarity prevents emotional over-trading and avoids forcing every ticker to meet the same objective.</p><p>Another practical improvement is to separate <em>entry quality</em> from <em>thesis quality</em>. Entry quality is judged by setup, liquidity, and confirmation. Thesis quality is judged by business durability and evidence depth. A high-thesis, low-entry setup should usually be watched, not chased. A medium-thesis, high-entry setup may still be tradable if sizing reflects fragility and catalyst uncertainty. This distinction is important because many drawdowns come from good ideas entered at poor moments.</p><p>In tactical sleeves, pre-commit your response to both favorable and unfavorable paths. If a position moves in your favor quickly into a known catalyst, partial profit-taking is rational because implied volatility and narrative expectations often outrun incremental evidence. If a position moves against you while evidence remains unchanged, do not immediately average down; first test whether macro and cross-asset context has shifted. Averaging down in a deteriorating regime often turns controlled risk into uncontrolled exposure.</p><p>For policy-sensitive names, always ask which part of the policy pipeline is moving: rhetoric, proposal, authorization, award, or recognized revenue. Market tends to price early pipeline stages aggressively, then re-rate when conversion speed disappoints. Concretely, a company can have strong headline flow and still miss near-term price expectations if implementation timelines slip. This is why catalyst calendars should include both event date and <em>transmission risk</em>.</p><p>Use conviction and fragility as separate coordinates. Conviction can rise with stronger evidence, but fragility can remain high if liquidity is thin, valuation is stretched, or event concentration is elevated. When conviction rises while fragility also rises, increase exposure slowly and rely on structure-based entries. When conviction rises and fragility falls together, the setup can justify larger staged adds. This two-axis view is more robust than a single “buy/sell” label.</p><p>Finally, maintain a post-close calibration ritual. For each meaningful position, write one sentence on what improved and one sentence on what weakened. Over several weeks, this creates a high-signal dataset of recurring failure patterns: late-cycle chasing, overreaction to isolated headlines, or underweighting policy timing risk. Process improvement from this routine tends to compound faster than marginal gains from adding more indicators.</p></div><div class='card'><h2>Forward-looking risk matrix (next 30 days)</h2><p><strong>Risk cluster 1: Duration shock.</strong> If inflation surprises to the upside or policy communication turns less dovish than expected, real yields can reprice abruptly. Portfolio response should prioritize reducing the highest valuation-sensitivity exposures first, especially where near-term cash-flow visibility is weak. Keep the strongest quality-growth names but lower tactical gross until cross-asset conditions stabilize.</p><p><strong>Risk cluster 2: Policy escalation.</strong> Additional tariff measures, export restrictions, or geopolitical escalation can alter revenue assumptions and margin paths without warning. Policy-sensitive sectors can gap both ways. Treat policy spikes as volatility events first and thesis events second. Initial risk action should focus on liquidity and fragility management before deep narrative interpretation.</p><p><strong>Risk cluster 3: Breadth deterioration under stable index levels.</strong> This is a common trap where index resilience hides increasing dispersion and weaker internals. If breadth weakens for multiple sessions while index remains near highs, raise quality thresholds for new adds and recycle capital toward names with stronger evidence freshness and better liquidity support.</p><p><strong>Risk cluster 4: Event concentration.</strong> Multiple earnings windows and macro prints in a short period can increase correlation risk. Avoid stacking too much exposure into overlapping catalysts. It is better to hold slightly lower gross with better diversification of event timing than to maximize notional exposure into clustered uncertainty.</p><p><strong>Upside cluster 1: soft-landing confirmation.</strong> If growth remains resilient while inflation cools and real yields ease, breadth can broaden meaningfully. In that case, tactical opportunities improve, but sequencing still matters: start with names showing evidence upgrades and positive signal delta, then expand to higher-beta names if confirmation persists.</p><p><strong>Upside cluster 2: policy clarity with execution follow-through.</strong> When policy direction becomes clearer and companies demonstrate conversion from announcements to measurable financial impact, dispersion can narrow and idiosyncratic alpha improves. This favors disciplined stock selection over broad thematic exposure.</p><p><strong>Upside cluster 3: liquidity normalization.</strong> If volume quality improves and unusual-move behavior becomes more orderly, fragility scores can decline even in active sectors. This is the ideal backdrop for staged position building because it allows better control of entry quality and downside asymmetry.</p><p>To operationalize this matrix, maintain a weekly scorecard with three columns: regime evidence, portfolio action taken, and outcome quality. The objective is not perfect forecasting; it is reducing unforced errors while preserving participation when probability-weighted conditions are favorable. Over time, this approach should increase consistency of returns and lower emotional variance, which is critical for compounding under uncertainty.</p></div><div class='card'><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li><a href='https://query1.finance.yahoo.com'>Yahoo Finance chart/quote endpoints</a></li><li><a href='https://query2.finance.yahoo.com/v10/finance/quoteSummary/'>Yahoo quoteSummary modules</a></li><li><a href='https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy.htm'>Federal Reserve policy resources</a></li><li><a href='https://www.reuters.com/markets/'>Reuters Markets</a></li></ul></div><p class='muted'>Updated: 2026-02-25T08:29:48+08:00</p></body></html>
