### 2026-02-24 00:28 HKT — Macro trade-policy shock (U.S. tariffs legal whipsaw)

**What happened**
Multiple Reuters updates indicate a major policy whipsaw: after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling struck down a broad set of prior tariffs, President Trump signaled/announced a temporary across-the-board tariff increase (10% to 15%) and further tariff threats tied to trade-deal compliance. Markets reportedly sold off on renewed policy uncertainty.

**Why it matters**
This is a cross-asset volatility catalyst (growth/inflation mix, supply-chain costs, USD/rates expectations, risk premia). It can reprice mega-cap tech and cyclicals quickly even without company-specific news.

**Watchlist impact**
Direct/meaningful sensitivity: AAPL, AVGO, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA, TSM, GOOG, IBM, BRK.B.
Second-order risk-on/off and defense-budget sentiment spillover: PLTR, KTOS, RKLB, RDW, BBAI, ONDS, UUUU.

**Quick interpretation**
- **Bull:** Negotiation theater; implementation diluted/delayed; risk assets recover as earnings (e.g., AI complex) dominate.
- **Base:** Persistent headline volatility and higher risk premium; stock selection matters more than index beta.
- **Bear:** Escalation/retaliation raises recession odds and margin pressure, driving broader de-risking.

### 2026-02-24 01:28 HKT — Update: tariff shock broadens into deeper risk-off move

**What happened**
Follow-through reports (Reuters market coverage) show the earlier tariff-policy whipsaw has translated into a broader equity drawdown during U.S. cash trading, with tech-heavy indices and mega-cap growth under renewed pressure as investors reprice trade-policy uncertainty.

**Why it matters**
This shifts the event from headline risk to active de-risking. A deeper index move can force positioning changes (gross/net cuts, beta reduction, factor rotation), especially into major event risk this week (notably NVDA earnings).

**Impacted watchlist tickers**
High beta / AI / trade-sensitive names most exposed: **NVDA, AVGO, TSLA, AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, TSM**.  
Spillover risk-on/off impact: **PLTR, RKLB, RDW, KTOS, BBAI, ONDS, UUUU, IBM, BRK.B**.

**Quick bull/base/bear**
- **Bull:** Policy softens quickly; volatility mean-reverts; quality AI leaders recover first.
- **Base:** Choppy tape with elevated risk premium until tariff scope/enforcement is clearer.
- **Bear:** Further escalation and retaliation drive a larger multi-session de-risking and downside gap risk in high-multiple tech.

### 2026-02-24 06:28 HKT — IBM plunges ~13% on AI-disruption narrative (Anthropic COBOL tooling)

**What happened**
IBM shares fell about 13% in U.S. trading after Anthropic highlighted new Claude Code capabilities around COBOL analysis/modernization, which investors interpreted as a threat to a legacy modernization profit pool tied to IBM.

**Why it matters**
This is an unusually large single-session move in watchlist constituent IBM and signals renewed multiple-compression risk for incumbents perceived as exposed to AI-driven service automation.

### 2026-02-24 06:29 HKT — Tesla files suit against California DMV over false-advertising ruling

**What happened**
Tesla sued the California DMV seeking to reverse/contest a ruling tied to allegedly misleading marketing around Autopilot/FSD terminology.

**Why it matters**
This is a material regulatory/legal development for TSLA and can prolong legal/regulatory overhang around autonomy-related claims.
