### 2026-02-24 00:28 HKT — Macro trade-policy shock (U.S. tariffs legal whipsaw)

**What happened**
Multiple Reuters updates indicate a major policy whipsaw: after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling struck down a broad set of prior tariffs, President Trump signaled/announced a temporary across-the-board tariff increase (10% to 15%) and further tariff threats tied to trade-deal compliance. Markets reportedly sold off on renewed policy uncertainty.

**Why it matters**
This is a cross-asset volatility catalyst (growth/inflation mix, supply-chain costs, USD/rates expectations, risk premia). It can reprice mega-cap tech and cyclicals quickly even without company-specific news.

**Watchlist impact**
Direct/meaningful sensitivity: AAPL, AVGO, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA, TSM, GOOG, IBM, BRK.B.
Second-order risk-on/off and defense-budget sentiment spillover: PLTR, KTOS, RKLB, RDW, BBAI, ONDS, UUUU.

**Quick interpretation**
- **Bull:** Negotiation theater; implementation diluted/delayed; risk assets recover as earnings (e.g., AI complex) dominate.
- **Base:** Persistent headline volatility and higher risk premium; stock selection matters more than index beta.
- **Bear:** Escalation/retaliation raises recession odds and margin pressure, driving broader de-risking.
