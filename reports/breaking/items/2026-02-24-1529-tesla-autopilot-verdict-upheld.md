# Tesla $243M Autopilot crash verdict upheld by U.S. judge

- **Time (HKT):** 2026-02-24 15:29 HKT
- **Ticker(s):** TSLA
- **Type:** Regulatory / legal action
- **Why material:** A federal judge upheld a large ($243M) jury verdict tied to Autopilot-related fatal-crash litigation, reinforcing legal liability overhang as Tesla pushes autonomy/robotaxi narrative.

## What happened
A U.S. federal judge rejected Tesla's bid to overturn a $243 million jury verdict connected to a 2019 fatal Autopilot-related crash, leaving the award intact (widely cited in Reuters-syndicated coverage).

## Potential positioning impact
- Keeps legal/regulatory headline risk elevated for TSLA.
- Could influence investor assumptions on autonomy commercialization timeline and litigation reserve risk.
- Negative sentiment risk if followed by additional rulings or enforcement developments.
