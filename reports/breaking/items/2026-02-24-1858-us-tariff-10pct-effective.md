- **Why material:** Reuters reported a new 10% additional U.S. tariff on goods not covered by exemptions, extending trade-policy uncertainty and potentially pressuring global growth/tech supply-chain risk premia.

## What happened
According to Reuters-syndicated reports, U.S. Customs and Border Protection notice set an additional 10% tariff from Tuesday on all goods not covered by exemptions. This is a fresh policy implementation update and keeps tariff uncertainty as a live macro driver.

## Potential positioning impact
- Extends risk-off pressure in tariff-sensitive sectors and globally exposed large-cap tech.
- Raises uncertainty around input costs/supply chains for hardware and semis.
- Keeps macro volatility elevated ahead of key earnings/events.
