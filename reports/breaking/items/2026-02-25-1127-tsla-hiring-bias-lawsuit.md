# U.S. judge lets anti-American hiring-bias lawsuit against Tesla proceed

- **Time (HKT):** 2026-02-25 11:27 HKT
- **Ticker(s):** TSLA
- **Type:** Regulatory/legal action
- **Why material:** A federal court decision allowing the case to continue adds legal overhang and headline risk around labor practices and potential damages/exposure.

## What happened
Reuters reported that a U.S. judge refused to dismiss a lawsuit alleging Tesla discriminated against American workers in hiring. The case now proceeds beyond dismissal stage.

## Potential positioning impact
- Adds legal-event risk and potential sentiment drag for TSLA.
- Increases uncertainty around labor/compliance narrative amid existing autonomy-related legal scrutiny.
- Could amplify volatility if discovery or follow-up rulings produce adverse details.
