## Fact
Reuters reports U.S. index futures down more than 1% amid prolonged Middle East conflict expectations; related copy cites defense names outperforming with KTOS up about 6.3% premarket.

## Risk scenario
If oil and shipping risk premia rise further into U.S. cash hours, de-risking may extend in high-duration growth/semis.
