- **Ticker(s):** Macro (watchlist sensitivity: AAPL, AVGO, MSFT, NVDA, GOOG, TSLA, TSM, IBM, BRK.B)
- **Type:** Macro policy shock (trade/tariff escalation risk)
- **Why material:** A move from 10% to 15% would be a meaningful escalation in trade-policy pressure and can reprice growth, margins, and risk appetite.

## What happened
Reuters reported a White House official said the administration is working to increase the temporary global tariff rate to 15% from 10%. This follows the recent implementation of the 10% baseline and keeps policy uncertainty elevated.

## Potential positioning impact
- Raises downside macro risk for globally exposed tech and cyclicals.
- Sustains higher volatility/risk premium and potential multiple compression.
- Increases scenario dispersion into major catalysts (including large-cap tech earnings).
