### 2026-02-24 06:28 HKT — IBM plunges ~13% on AI-disruption narrative (Anthropic COBOL tooling)

**What happened**
IBM shares fell about 13% in U.S. trading after Anthropic highlighted new Claude Code capabilities around COBOL analysis/modernization, which investors interpreted as a threat to a legacy modernization profit pool tied to IBM.

**Why it matters**
This is an unusually large single-session move in a watchlist constituent (**IBM**) and signals renewed multiple/compression risk for incumbents perceived as exposed to AI-driven service automation.

**Impacted watchlist tickers**
- Direct: **IBM**
- Sentiment spillover to enterprise/legacy IT and AI-transition names: **MSFT, GOOG, AVGO, NVDA** (second-order)

**Positioning lens**
- **Bull:** Move is overdone versus IBM’s diversified cashflow and enterprise lock-in.
- **Base:** Higher volatility around AI-disruption headlines; valuation support matters more.
- **Bear:** Market continues repricing legacy service revenue durability, extending downside in related incumbents.
