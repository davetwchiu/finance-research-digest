### 2026-02-24 01:28 HKT — Update: tariff shock broadens into deeper risk-off move

**What happened**
Follow-through market coverage indicates the earlier U.S. tariff-policy whipsaw has moved from headline uncertainty into broader equity selling, with tech-heavy and high-beta exposures under pressure.

**Why it matters**
This now looks like active de-risking (not just noise), increasing probability of positioning changes (beta cuts, multiple compression risk) ahead of key catalysts this week.

**Impacted watchlist tickers**
- Most exposed: NVDA, AVGO, TSLA, AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, TSM
- Secondary spillover: PLTR, RKLB, RDW, KTOS, BBAI, ONDS, UUUU, IBM, BRK.B

**Quick bull/base/bear**
- **Bull:** Policy tone softens quickly; volatility fades; AI leaders rebound first.
- **Base:** Choppy, headline-driven tape with elevated risk premium until tariff scope/enforcement is clearer.
- **Bear:** Escalation/retaliation drives multi-session de-risking and deeper downside in high-multiple growth.
