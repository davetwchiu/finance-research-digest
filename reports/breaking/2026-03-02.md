### 2026-03-02 10:38 HKT — Material macro shock: Hormuz disruption after U.S.-Israel strikes on Iran

**What happened**
Multiple major outlets (Reuters, Bloomberg, NYT, Guardian, CNBC live coverage) report that after U.S.-Israel strikes on Iran, Tehran signaled/attempted closure pressure in the Strait of Hormuz and shipping flow was disrupted, with multiple tanker owners/oil majors/traders suspending transit.

Key confirmations captured this run:
- Reuters (energy): oil/gas majors and traders suspended Hormuz shipments.
- Reuters (regional): Russia warning of oil choke risk from Hormuz closure dynamics.
- Reuters (Asia): Japan shippers halting Hormuz operations.
- Cross-outlet pickup (Bloomberg/NYT/Guardian/Al Jazeera/CNBC) indicates broad confirmation of shipping disruption and elevated escalation risk.

**Why it matters for current watchlist**
- **Macro-first impact:** raises oil/inflation risk premium and likely tightens global financial conditions.
- **Equity transmission:** tends to pressure duration-sensitive/valuation-rich tech (NVDA/MSFT/GOOG/TSLA/PLTR/AVGO) via higher discount-rate + risk-off channel.
- **Second-order:** if sustained, may hit logistics/input costs and compress multiples even where AI-demand fundamentals remain intact.

**Confidence**
High on disruption signal (multi-source, Reuters-led). Event path is fast-moving and headline-sensitive.

### 2026-03-02 10:38 HKT — Semiconductor demand datapoint (supportive, not a fresh shock)

**What happened**
Reuters + cross-pickups report South Korea February exports beat forecasts; semiconductor exports rose ~160.9% YoY and remained above $20B for a third consecutive month.

**Why it matters for current watchlist**
Supportive for AI/semiconductor demand read-through (NVDA/TSM/AVGO chain), but this is a **supporting macro demand confirmation**, not a new idiosyncratic company-specific break.

**Confidence**
High (Reuters + wide pickup).

### 2026-03-02 14:08 HKT — Token-saving breaking monitor check (no new material event)

**Scan scope**
- Watchlist: AAPL, AVGO, BBAI, KTOS, MSFT, NVDA, ONDS, PLTR, RDW, RKLB, TSLA, TSM, UUUU, GOOG, IBM, BRK.B, LITE.
- Macro shock lanes: Hormuz/energy supply stress, inflation-rate repricing, geopolitical escalation transmission.

**Findings this run**
- No fresh multi-source, thesis-changing idiosyncratic headline detected across the watchlist in this pass.
- Prior Hormuz disruption remains the dominant active macro overhang; latest Reuters-led flow still frames this as persistence (high oil-risk premium), not clear de-escalation.
- Broad web-index results for single-name scans were mostly stale/low-signal; no single-source rumor was promoted.

**Source confidence note**
- Confidence on "no new material break" read: moderate (high on macro persistence via Reuters, lower on long-tail single-name coverage in this lightweight pass).
- Any low-confidence or single-source items were treated as provisional/non-actionable.


### 2026-03-02 15:08 HKT — Token-saving breaking monitor check (no new material event)

**A (Builder) scan**
- Watchlist sweep: AAPL, AVGO, BBAI, KTOS, MSFT, NVDA, ONDS, PLTR, RDW, RKLB, TSLA, TSM, UUUU, GOOG, IBM, BRK.B, LITE.
- Macro shock lanes: Middle East conflict/Hormuz flow risk, oil-inflation-rate repricing, broad risk-off transmission.

**B (Gate) validation**
- Highest-quality confirmation in this run remains Reuters-level macro framing: elevated oil/risk premium persistence tied to Middle East conflict.
- No fresh multi-source, company-specific catalyst met thesis-change threshold for the watchlist in this pass.
- A Reuters-indexed NVDA chip-planning item (WSJ-sourced) appears incremental/previous-cycle rather than a new break; treated as non-alert.

**Fact vs interpretation vs risk scenario**
- **Fact:** No new multi-source, thesis-changing single-name event identified this hour.
- **Interpretation:** Regime remains macro-led (energy/geopolitics), not idiosyncratic watchlist-fundamental-driven.
- **Risk scenario:** If Hormuz risk escalates further, next impact channel is renewed multiple compression in duration-sensitive tech and higher input/logistics pressure.

**Confidence:** Moderate-high.
**Source quality note:** Reuters-led macro checks strong; long-tail web index results were mostly stale/noisy and filtered out.

### 2026-03-02 16:08 HKT — Token-saving breaking monitor check (no new material event)

**A (Builder) scan**
- Watchlist sweep: AAPL, AVGO, BBAI, KTOS, MSFT, NVDA, ONDS, PLTR, RDW, RKLB, TSLA, TSM, UUUU, GOOG, IBM, BRK.B, LITE.
- Macro shock lanes: Middle East escalation/oil shock, inflation-rate repricing, US risk-off transmission.

**B (Gate) validation**
- Reuters-level macro signal still dominates: Iran-war escalation continues to anchor elevated oil/risk premium (persistence, not clearly new escalation this hour).
- No fresh multi-source, thesis-changing single-name catalyst found in this run.
- Reuters item on TSLA Denmark registrations (-18% YoY) treated as regional datapoint, below thesis-change threshold for portfolio positioning.

**Fact vs interpretation vs risk scenario**
- **Fact:** No new multi-source, thesis-changing event this hour.
- **Interpretation:** Market regime remains macro/geopolitics-led; watchlist still driven more by beta/valuation sensitivity than new idiosyncratic fundamentals.
- **Risk scenario:** Any additional Iran-linked supply disruption (shipping/energy infrastructure) could trigger another leg of oil-led de-risking and multiple compression in high-duration tech.

**Confidence:** Moderate-high.
**Source quality note:** Core read anchored on Reuters wires/cross-pickups; non-tier and single-source items filtered as non-actionable.

### 2026-03-02 17:08 HKT — Token-saving breaking monitor check (no new material event)

**A (Builder) scan**
- Watchlist sweep: AAPL, AVGO, BBAI, KTOS, MSFT, NVDA, ONDS, PLTR, RDW, RKLB, TSLA, TSM, UUUU, GOOG, IBM, BRK.B, LITE.
- Macro shock lanes: Middle East conflict/oil-shock transmission, inflation-rate repricing, broad US risk-off.

**B (Gate) validation**
- Highest-quality confirmation this run: CNBC live update (Reuters-sourced market color) still indicates macro risk-off tied to U.S.-Israel/Iran escalation and oil spike; treated as continuation, not a fresh escalation.
- No fresh multi-source, thesis-changing single-name catalyst detected across the watchlist.
- No weak/single-source rumor promoted to alert status.

**Fact vs interpretation vs risk scenario**
- **Fact:** No new multi-source, thesis-changing watchlist event this hour.
- **Interpretation:** Regime remains macro-led; idiosyncratic watchlist fundamentals did not materially change in this pass.
- **Risk scenario:** If shipping/energy disruption broadens, next likely transmission remains oil-led de-risking and multiple pressure in high-duration tech.

**Confidence:** Moderate.
**Source quality note:** Reuters direct fetch was blocked; this run used CNBC live coverage with Reuters-attributed details plus broad index checks, so confidence is lower than direct wire confirmation.

- Fresh web-indexed flow continues to show broad coverage of the existing Hormuz/oil shock narrative (Reuters-attributed across major outlets), but no clearly new escalation/de-escalation confirmation in this hour.
- Reuters-indexed single-name item (NVDA new AI processor, WSJ-sourced) appears incremental and below thesis-change threshold for immediate positioning action.
- No fresh multi-source, thesis-changing company-specific catalyst detected across the watchlist in this pass.

**Fact vs interpretation vs risk scenario**
- **Fact:** No new multi-source, thesis-changing watchlist event this hour.
- **Interpretation:** Regime remains macro-led; watchlist sensitivity still primarily via oil/rates/risk-premium channels.
- **Risk scenario:** If verified shipping disruption broadens or persists into U.S. session, high-duration tech could face another leg of valuation compression.
